Some notes---hope to expand further---on the surprising number of additional website issues I faced when trying to include more photos on my blog.

- authoring
    - taking more photos
        - at more angles
        - w/ more lenses
    - selecting
    - editing
    - narrative construction based on good photos
        - not intrinsic (but non-photographable) beauty
        - not genuine interest
    - placement
    - pruning (slow here)
    - writing captions

- images themselves
    - interlaced / progressive
    - choosing the right size
    - multiple sizes
    - lazy loading
    - formats (e.g., WebP)
    - color space
    - compression tools
    - compression level (& options)
    - pre-sending heights

- layouts
    - general: redesigning
    - height matching
    - viewport height limiting
    - width matching
    - small device wrapping
    - background generation
    - appearing during scrolling problem

- storage
    - clogging git repo
    - GH pages limit << repo limit
    - separate hosting
    - CDN
