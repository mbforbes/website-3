title: Restructuring 3D notes
date: 2023-02-26
series: 3D Notebook
---

**Studies.** I'd like to work on focused studies. If I want to, I can post the result as a sketch, but it's not required. From each study, I will probably learn 1--_n_ techniques. I may start the study with a specific technique to explore, like skyboxes or animated fluids.

**Topic notes: explanations and/or quick guides.** I'd like to organize these techniques into topics, like projections, lighting, underwater, level of detail, and scene composition. From the study, I can link to 1--_n_ notes for the topics. Some of the topics will span 3js and MagicaVoxel (and blender?), and could have specific sections for each program. For example, a depth of field guide could have a general section, then subsections for (a) achieving it in 3js, (b) working with it in MagicaVoxel. Some of these subsections will purely be quick guides. Some topics will only be quick guides for a single software, like doing screen resolution correctly in 3js, or a cheat sheet to using MagicaVoxel shaders.

If we called the series[^seriesorder] "3D Notebook," the index would look like:[^breakup]

[^seriesorder]: Right now the series order expects sequential numbers. Eventually, I might want to allow this to be sorted by date or title.

[^breakup]: If desired, I could even break into separate sections: 3D Studies and 3D notebook; or even Three.js Studies, MagicaVoxel Studies, and 3D Notebook.

**3D Notebook**
- 3js display
- Lighting
- Underwater
- Scene composition
- Scene composition
- Study: animated poster (web)
- Study: night pool (vox)

Reasons behind all this.

I'd like to have studies with (a) a small scope, (b) a clear end, (c) only optionally posted as sketches, (d) guides collected in notes.
- I want to complete more to get more under my belt, for which (a) and (b) will help.
- I also don't want each to feel like it needs to figure out all graphics tricks and look perfect, which (a) and (c) will help.
- I do want to build towards understanding more graphics techniques and write them down (d)

Questions

- Is everything constrained to be a study? What about things that fail, like my underwater scenes or Ryu posts?

    - I could either post as something like _Study: XXX (Failed)_ or _Failed study: XXX._ (Then not post a sketch, obvi.) Or I could post any examples inline in the relevant section, like I have right now.

- What about guides where I want to collect examples from others?

    - I just keep these on my own. To encourage not keeping two sets of notes, could keep in mood boards (try out Freeform).
