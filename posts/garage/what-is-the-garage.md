The **garage**[^name] is a new experiment (starting June 2021) with "working with the garage door up." It's inspired by [Alex's evergreen notes](https://notes.spacefiller.space/), which were in turn inspired by [Andy's evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/).

## What do they look like?

Unlike how I've built this site so far, these notes will:

- **Change.** I will add notes, update them, split them, and delete them with complete abandon. As such, if you link to any page on my site that has `/garage/` in the URL, be warned it might go away.

- **Be written for me by default.** This means (a) they might be terse, verbose, or confusing, (b) they will almost certainly be in dire need of editing, and (c) I will hedge way less than I ordinarily feel comfortable with. [The idea behind this](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z8AfCaQJdp852orumhXPxHb3r278FHA9xZN8J) is that writing for others substantially increases the overhead of writing, especially when you're still figuring out an idea's shape.[^habit]

- **Be incomplete.** I'll post note stubs, partial outlines, broken code, and incomplete ideas.

## Why do this?

When [Alex](https://spacefiller.space/) told me about these evergreen notes, I was totally uninterested. But I've completely changed my mind, for three reasons.

First, I'm interested in exploring a semi-structured approach to thinking.[^creativereading] Right now, my process is either extremely unconstrained or highly constrained:

constraints | speed | process
:-- | :-- | :--
Low | Instant | Jotting down anything in my personal notes: recipes, websites, screenshots, tiny ideas, resources, reminders, etc.
High | Very slow | Developing an essay to share publicly. Longform writing and laborious editing.

The compelling aspect of evergreen notes---which seems similar to a [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)---is that it presents a middle way between these two extremes:[^replace]

constraints | speed | process
:-- | :-- | :--
Medium | Moderate | Creating, growing, and inter-linking webpage snippets centered around my work and interests

In other words, it presents a _thinking tool_ by imposing some amount of structure (atomic ideas that are linked together) which can serve as conceptual scaffolding.

The second reason is I think posting in this way can really help my working process for my website. I [realized recently]({{ "/blog/the-distant-rumble-of-change/" | url }}) that I can think of my _website process_ as the cross product of design, content, workflow, technology, and audience. I also realized that my process currently sucks. I post rarely, it's a ton of work per post, and I don't really love it. It doesn't spark joy.

Just realizing this was a great step. But with a magical synchronicity, I realized this right as I was hearing about evergreen notes. And it dawned on me that they might present liberating variations on all the axes of my current website process [that have been paralyzing me since, apparently, at least 2016]({{ "/posts/paralysis/" | url }}):

axis | post | garage
:-- | :-- | :--
**Design** | Standalone | Inter-linked
**Containment** | Self-contained argument | Isolated idea
**Content** | Mostly text | Text, visual, animated, code, ...
**Workflow** | Very slow, revisions and editing | Quick and evolving
**Audience** | General or technical public | Me
**Visibility** | High: posted to social media | Low: Most people won't care
**Access** | _Public_ | _Public_
**Mutability** | Rarely, also irrelevant after initial share | Endlessly
**Date-oriented** | Yes: "publish date" | No; optional "start date"
**Delete-ability** | No | Yes
**Polish** | High | Low
**Structure** | Rhetoric | Links

Because it ended up being so important, I want to emphasize this point: I had been conflating three factors in thinking about what content I made:

1. **Audience** — who is this written _for_?
2. **Visibility** — who will _likely_ read it?
3. **Access** — who could _possibly_ read it?

Since anything I post on my website has public **access**, I assumed that made every way of posting the same. I now see how many other axes of variation there are.

The final reason is that I think work-in-progress, semi-personal sections of people's websites, like this, are the best part of the internet. I love reading them. But I didn't have one myself! Since I wish everyone I knew used something like this, the best thing I can do is start one.

## Why "Garage," not "Evergreen notes?"

I just love the idea of "working with the garage door up" so much. It perfectly captures the vibe I want. Plus, I like that "garage" is one word.

And if you ask me, Alex's [crystal analogy](https://notes.spacefiller.space/evergreen-notes/) is even better:

> Like a crystal, they should grow over time, solidifying your thoughts into a network that you can build from.

... though I guess we need some way for the crystal to change its internal structure over time, as notes evolve. Evergreen crystals?

[^name]: Is the _garage_ a weird name for this? Probably. Add it to the long list of [tiny naming woes]({{ "/garage/tiny-naming-woes/" | url }}).

[^habit]: Actually, writing for others is going to be a hard habit to break. Some notes, like this one, are written to be much more public facing. I suspect it will be a learning process to stop doing that.

[^creativereading]: On the topic of semi-strctured thinking: here, I'm using my own ideas as scaffolding. Relatedly [creative reading]({{ "/posts/creative-reading/" | url }}) is using someone else's ideas as scaffolding.

[^replace]: In around 2019 or 2020, I got really close to replacing my low-constraint process with a Zettelkasten, but doing _everything_ as text was too limiting. I like images and paper too much!
