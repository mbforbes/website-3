I tried another version with a much lower voxel resolution.

## Critique

Good
- Size +level of detail much better than last attempt (cute rather than creepy)
- More scene objects make composition nice

Bad
- Size a bit too small; character can’t even really have eyes
    - (but i am glad i tried a much smaller size to start!)
- Color palette a bit weird; pastel-y / washed
- Scales off; trees should be much bigger
- Fence too prominent — maybe further back and dimmer
- More details would liven things up; apples, hints of animals / other chars, some terrain, ...
