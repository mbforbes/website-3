One tendency I struggle with is how to balance two modes:

1. **Deciding.** Planning.

2. **Following.** Executing on the plan.

Planning is satisfying. Following is also satisfying. But.

When the plan inevitably goes wrong, what do you do?

For me, rather than jumping back to _following_ as quickly as possible, I re-enter _planning_. I start thinking:

- What was the problem with the plan?
- Should I revise the plan? Should I totally scrap it?
- How can I make sure I don't encounter this problem again?
- What are the properties of better plans (etc etc etc).

One's frequency of reassessment is delicate. Not enough, and you could walk down a foolish path for eons. Too frequent, and you spin around in circles, never making progress on any path.

This might be why goals are useful. A goal is grounded in a particular fantasy, whereas a plan is a means.

A plan falling apart can reveal an arbitrary goal.

One tricky case might be when the plan _is_ the goal. For example, _establishing a new process_ **as** the goal. For example, I'd like to get all of my queued up ideas for writing done as soon as I can. But really, I want the _process_ of publishing to be smoother and faster. I can invent a goal---e.g., publish everything I've sketched out by the end of September---and make a plan. But if the plan falls apart, it may be difficult to conjure up again, because the goal was arbitrary.
