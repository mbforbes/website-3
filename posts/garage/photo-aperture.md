My range: f1.7 -- f16

## Case Study: Pourover

Starting on full auto to just begin using the camera, wide apertures were often picked. This led to very shallow depth of fields where not always intended.

Aside from picking a shorter [shutter speed](/garage/photo-shutter-speed/), the depth of field is ludicrously shallow. Looking at it after the fact, I realized the area around his left wrist is the only part of the image visibly in focus.

## Case Study: Cup

This is f2.8. I don't know if it was on macro mode (must have been, right?) but like, only the wood grain in front of the cup is in focus.

## Case Study: Osaka

I shot landscapes on full auto. They were all shot in random apertures. Nothing huge, but nothing intentional. Usually around f5 or f6.

{% img2 {path: "/assets/garage/photo-notebook/aperture-osaka.moz80.jpg"} %}

<p class="figcaption">Osaka [f5.6]</p>

When I zoom into that photo of Osaka, I still can't tell whether things are in focus or not. Fully zoomed out, it looks good. But as soon as I go zooming in, everything looks a bit blurry. I don't know if I'm expecting too much, or if f5.6 is still too big. I can tell I'm focused into the skyline because the wire gate is clearly out of focus. But beyond that, I really don't know.

If I crop to an actual-size snippet, it looks good. So I think I was zooming in too far and expecting too much.

This also helped me learn there's an actual-size zoom in Photomator (⌘1), which displays the pixels at 1:1, accounting for pixel density.

## Rough Aperture Guidelines

I finally did some reading about the ultra basics of camera settings, learned about aperture (probably for the fifth time), and realized that I ought to be picking it.

I shot some more, and eventually learned some rough aperture guidelines. These were often offhand comments at the end of YouTube videos (e.g., _"this is why it's well-known street photographers love f8,"_ or _"everybody knows you can get clear landscapes at f11"_). These looked like:

Aperture | Situation
--- | ---
f1.7 | Ultra-narrow DOF
f2.8 | Portraits, so whole face in focus
f4 | Street photography (source: street photographer)
f8 | Street photography (source: some guy who I think isn't a street photographer)
f11 | Landscapes
f16 | Landscapes, maybe actually?

At the same time, I finally learned that the amount of a scene that's in focus depends not only on the aperture, but the distance to the subject. So If you're shooting something close at f1.7, only a tiny sliver of it will be in focus. But if you're shooting something far away at f1.7, a huge range will be in focus.

I also learned that the range that's in focus isn't symmetric around the focal point; it/s 1/3 and 2/3, but I forget whether 1/3 is in front or behind.

However, I still haven't gotten it nailed down. For most situations, I'm guessing wildly.
- If I'm walking around snapping quick photos ("street photography"), do I prefer f4 or f8? Or maybe even f2.8?
- More generally, for medium-distance subjects, how much will be in focus for f1.7 -- f8?
- For landscapes, do I pick f11 or f16?
- For most landscapes, is way lower---f4 or even f2.8 or f1.7---going to be OK?

## Case Study: Niigata Tetrapod Beach

When shooting still stuff (which is still most of what I shoot; habit from the iPhone), I often try many different apertures. For a landscape I don't want to ruin, I'll blast through many stops. I plan to go back and scrutinize and learn, though I've been on the road so much I've accumulated weeks of photos without the chance to do that yet.

Here's a beach in Niigata at both f1.7 and f11.

] %}

<p class="figcaption">Niigata Tetrapod Beach [f1.7, f11]</p>

Can you tell which is better? I can't.^[The exposures are ended up slightly different, but I think this is just the camera's natural variance in tweaking variables to try to get the exposure the same (the f1.7 is 1/6400s, and the f11 is 1/160s). I think this slight difference is well within the editable range in post.]

## Case Study: Niigata Rooftops

Another case where I tried many f-stops.

    ],

        "/assets/garage/photo-notebook/aperture-niigata-roofs-f16.moz80.jpg"
    ]
] %}

<p class="figcaption">Niigata Roofs [f2.8, f4, f8, f11, f16]</p>

Aside from learning that f16 is so small that the [shutter speed](/garage/photo-shutter-speed/) dropped below what I could hold still, I still can't tell anything from the above. Even when I zoom into the f2.8, I can't see where the photo is focused, nor what the focus area is.

This is an instance where I would like to simply know the answer (of what's in focus) for a handful of f-stops and distances. I think learning involves a there's a combination of experience (trial and error) and knowledge (being told answers), and this is one I ought to look up.

## Rough Aperture Guesses On The Go

For out-and-about photos, I ended up correcting way down towards smaller apertures. I picked f4 for a lot of shots, going even narrower for landscapes, occasionally dialing it to f2.8, and almost never touching f1.7.^[Did any of these improve by having f &gt; 1.7? I don't think so. I think if I could have focused on the subject, f1.7 could have improved all of them.]

## Back to f1.7

Then, I read [Craig Mod's Leica Q essay](https://craigmod.com/essays/leica_q/) again.

He shoots nearly everything on f1.7. There are literally two photos that aren't: a portrait (f3.2) and a macro (f5)^[OK there is a third that's f1.8 but I have to imagine that's not doing much.]. The other twenty-three are all at f1.7.

Furthermore, he is extremely convincing that this power should be used:

> Were it topped out at f2 or f2.4, I don’t think the effect would be as pronounced. But because the Q’s 28mm opens to f1.7, you’re able to achieve what I can only describe as voyeuristic cinema. [It produces] otherworldly (or, hyperworldly) scenes as if lifted from a film. I’ve grown to love the subtle qualities of these images. I suppose this is the so-called Leica feel everyone talks about.

The next day, I opened it wide up again. I 1.7'd all over the place.

And it worked. I think almost every photo is improved by having a stronger focus on the subject. Even landscape-y ones can benefit from having a specific part that's attended to.

] %}

Looking at Mod's many f1.7 photos again, I realized that they're mainly of medium-distance subjects, far enough away to be in focus, then cropped in. Some still confuse me: the [uncropped calligrapher photo](https://craigmod.com/essays/images/leica_q/calligrapher-uncropped-high.jpg) seems to have more in focus than I'd get at f1.7 at that distance. But my eye isn't great yet, and I still have a hard time telling exactly how much of a photo even is in focus.

My rule-of-thumb now is:
- close-ups (food, faces): f2.8+
- everything medium distance: f1.7
- landscapes: ???
- stylistically: probably try other f-stops as desired, but no strong direction right now

## Drawing the Eye

> Over time, you learn to use both a combination of light and sharpness to guide the eye in a way that isn’t possible (without more work) on the iPhone. --- [Craig Mod, Leica Q](https://craigmod.com/essays/leica_q/)

Mod was referencing f1.7 in this quote (it continues the above pull), but even at f2.8, I can see this at work.

## Next goals

I want to understand why so many landscapes at f1.7 have so much in focus. I want to use the formula for at least f1.7 and see how much is in focus for different distances.
