The word "studio" sounds like a pretentious name for that section of my website. I'm not an artist or an architect---why should I get to call it that?

But look, there are so many other options that didn't work:

name | risks conflation with
:-- | :--
Workshop | Topic-focused academic gatherings
Lab | A group of people working on research together
Projects | Research topics that span multiple papers
Experiments | Small focused scientific tests

Anyway.
