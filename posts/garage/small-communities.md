Visiting climbing gyms that are just getting their legs under them---usually in smaller cities---is bittersweet.

It's lovely because it's a prime example of a small community. The gym _is_ the community. Everyone sort of knows everyone. You go to the climbing gym to climb, but also to hang out. Everyone there is your crew.

It's a bit sad for me to visit, though, because I'm jealous. (a) I'm always an outsider at those gyms, and (b) I'll probably never be a part of one. Seattle, for example, has such a hunger for climbing gyms that any new one becomes swamped, both with established climbers and newcomers.

A larger friend group is a community, and I think has many of the same benefits. But I think a semi-public community, like a climbing gym, is in a different category. Since it's technically public, it's lower friction to have new people come. And engagement is high, because if people aren't interested, they won't come. Plus, there's a shared purpose.

I think these ingredients lead to fun and creativity in the space because people are more involved. The mechanics naturally discourage [spectators](/garage/spectators/).
