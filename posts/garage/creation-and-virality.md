When I'm creating something, a nonzero portion of my thoughts are about whether it will become big and successful.

This is a new phenomenon for me, definitely post-Internet. It is lame.

This seems useful to worry about sometimes, like if you're running a business and you want to get a bigger market.

But for the human act of crafting as a source of pleasure and stimulation, it colors and distracts from the process.
