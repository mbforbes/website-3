What's interesting is that voxel resolution isn't the same thing as level of detail used. This goes both ways.

1. There are coarse voxel resolutions that use an extremely high detail density.

2. There are fine voxel resolutions that use a low detail density.

The second category is interesting. The fine voxel resolution is used sparingly for small shapes and details (e.g., a mustache). However, the _overall design style_ is kept more block-like to emphasize the voxel theme.

A related design choice: drawing arms straight, then animating, rather than drawing on a voxel grid.

This style (low detail density) is an obvious choice given my abilities. But it's still challenging.
