The _spirit of discovery_ is wanting to figure something out for yourself rather than look up the answer.

While it [feels silly to say](/garage/critiquing-internet-use/), the Internet has diminished my spirit of discovery. It feels inefficient to try something yourself when the answer is an instant Google away.

> Aside: There's also a chance I'm getting the wrong read on this, and it's not just (a) the Internet, but that I'm situated (b) in computer science, or (c) in academia. It could be a mixture of all three.

One recent brief attempt to rekindle this in myself was wondering whether [k-means on an image's colors makes a good palette](/garage/does-k-means-on-an-images-colors-make-a-good-palette/).
