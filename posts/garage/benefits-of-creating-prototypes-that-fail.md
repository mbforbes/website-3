title: Benefits of creating prototypes that fail

This is a commonly held belief in the tech world, so I'm writing this really for myself.

Creating prototypes that fail is good because:

- You won't have good ideas off the start, because [when you're new at something, you'll probably get excited by trivial or surface things](/garage/deeper-ideas-in-pocket/). You must work through your early ideas to discover the deeper ones. If you developed prototypes to full completion, you would be wasting your time, because the purpose of building early ideas is to learn about the idea space, not polish your first idea.

- There's also a process of learning how to build---and even polish. Working on early projects teaches you how to do that, so you'll be more proficient with later ones.
