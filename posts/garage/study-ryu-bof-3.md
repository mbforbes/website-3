## 12/31/21 --- Part 1

HAHAHA, he came out so terrifying.

I think I made him too big for the amount of detail I'm actually comfortable doing.

This is a critical aspect of voxeling: [level of detail](/garage/level-of-detail/).

## 7/19/22 --- Part 2

I tried another version with a much lower voxel resolution.

### Critique

Good
- Size +level of detail much better than last attempt (cute rather than creepy)
- More scene objects make composition nice

Bad
- Size a bit too small; character can’t even really have eyes
    - (but i am glad i tried a much smaller size to start!)
- Color palette a bit weird; pastel-y / washed
- Scales off; trees should be much bigger
- Fence too prominent — maybe further back and dimmer
- More details would liven things up; apples, hints of animals / other chars, some terrain, ...
