title: Causes and conditions

This is a mode of thinking that looks at the web/cloud/set of causes and conditions leading up to---and surrounding---an event, rather than just the event itself.

You can trace these with dizzying depth and breadth.

This robs the event of mystery (in a helpful way), posing it as a natural followup to the infinite web of what came before. It encourages thinking broadly and blamelessly.
