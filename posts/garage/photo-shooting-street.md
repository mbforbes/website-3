There's probably a better term for it, but by _shooting street_ I mean getting primed to take photos more quickly while walking around.

Doing this was an unexpected huge mental shift in how I thought about taking photos. It's difficult to overstate.

Here are the changes I made:

What | Normal | Shooting Street
--- | --- | ---
Camera position | Waist | Held in hand
Camera strap | Across shoulders | Wrapped around wrist
Camera state | Off | On
Aperture | ??? | f4^[Sometimes I set it to f1.7 or f2.8 or f8. The point is that rather than assume I will choose it when a photo comes, I know at all times what it's set to.]

In other words, walking around with the camera always on, held in your hand, primed to go.

The first few times I tried this, it was a rush. It gave me energy. It made me walk faster, made me almost walk around _hungrily_ to take photos. I took more risks, snapped photos of insides of shops and people on the street, things I would never normally do.

Being primed like this also means I take more photos overall. I now think of taking photos as an active process. Not just walking around, not just searching for shots, but trying things out. Lowering the barrier to taking a photo meant I experimented more.

And, given how bad my photos have started out, more practice is a good thing.
