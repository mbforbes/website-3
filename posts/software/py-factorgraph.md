This is a tiny Python library for building factor graphs and running the (loopy) belief propagation algorithm. At the time, I could not find an easy-to-use library for building factor graphs, only huge packages specializing in other graphical models. Those are probably still better choices, but I learned a lot implementing this one. Made for the Verb Physics paper.
