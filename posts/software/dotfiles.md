I think dotfiles (named because they often start with a dot, like `.bashrc`) are a fun window into someone's work environment. (And probably a time capsule of when they started working with unix-esque systems.) My favorite trick is to [name custom scripts starting with a comma](https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2009/commands-with-comma/).
