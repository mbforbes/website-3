Playing so much Pokémon Puzzle League that not only do I dream about it, but my normal dreams---i.e., where I am in some bizarre situation and must accomplish some task---have Pokémon Puzzle League gameplay as the substance. E.g., I have to solve some relationship problem, but the way I do that is trying to get a vertical 4-combo on water blocks. It's actually too much.
