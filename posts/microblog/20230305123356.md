Encountered a cool instant ramen format twice now on accident. It comes with two bowls. Thought it was a packing mistake, but the instructions say to use one bowl + seasoning to make a soup from the noodle broth, and the second bowl for noodles + paste.

Big soup culture. Most restaurant meals seem to come with a starter soup. Nice.
