After writing TypeScript for _(how many years?!)_ I just discovered their [reference sheet for utility types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html) and I can't believe what I've been missing. Even just the simple `Record<K,T>` I could have used so many times.

This is one side benefit of having GPT-4 try to write code for you: it will use common stuff you didn't realize was common and you'll learn about it.
