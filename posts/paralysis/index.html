          <p><img src="/website-3/assets/posts/paralysis/rain_min_tk.jpg" alt="A photo of a sliver of Tokyo through a rainy window using pseudo tilt shift photography to make everything look tiny"></p>
<p>During the past seven years I have struggled immensely to produce independent<br>
creative work. Today I realized one reason why: complexity.</p>
<p>Part of learning is realizing that things you thought were simple—why plants<br>
grow, what makes good writing, how to play an instrument well—are actually<br>
complex. After you see processes like these broken apart enough times, you can<br>
learn to do it yourself. You develop the ability to unearth complexity in<br>
seemingly simple things; in other words, you start to engage in dissective<br>
thinking.</p>
<p>Here are a few activities that I might try to dissect:</p>
<ul>
<li>writing</li>
<li>reading</li>
<li>composing music</li>
<li>creating visual art</li>
<li>programming</li>
<li>designing interfaces</li>
<li>thinking</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is scary: you can think critically about thinking. Round and round<br>
you go, deeper and deeper, way down.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Interlude</h2>

</p>
<h2>Complexity</h2>
<p>To avoid stagnating in the abstract, I’ve cataloged some of my own dissective<br>
thinking here for two of the above activities: writing and composing music.<br>
There’s no particular order to the bullets here.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What type of vocabulary should I use? Should I stretch and create like<br>
David Foster Wallace (DFW)?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> Or should I keep my words simple like Paul<br>
Graham (PG)?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long and complex should my sentences be? (DFW and PG make a sharp<br>
contrast in this regard as well.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What facts about myself should I reveal? If I reveal whether I went to<br>
college or which authors I’ve read, will this attract or alienate readers?<br>
And which ones?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who is my audience?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How should a piece of writing be structured? Should there be a running<br>
story? Interludes? References to previous parts of the story? Should I use<br>
endnotes? How long should it be?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should I include pictures? Music? Media might help retain readers, but it<br>
could also distract them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What sort of prescriptive rules should I follow? Should I worry about<br>
applying Strunk and White?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> Or Matt Might?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> Snippets of rules<br>
from various high school English classes drift back: use metaphor and<br>
simile; vary sentence length; use active voice; use interesting verbs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What should my tone be? Light? Serious?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should I have friends read my writing? Whose edits should I trust?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has someone had the same thought already? Surely, someone’s already<br>
thought and written about exactly this better than I could do, so what’s<br>
the point?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have I even read and analyzed enough writing to do it myself? I should<br>
probably read critically more before I try writing myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And, in the rare event that the above isn’t paralyzing enough to keep me<br>
from starting in the first place, I think throughout: what will people<br>
think of me from my writing?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Composing music</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In which genre should I compose? “Classical?” Jazz? Electronic?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which instruments should be in the piece?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should I try to make the composition be performable? Should I be able to<br>
perform it, given my skill level and the instruments I can play?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it melodically interesting? Is it catchy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where do the phrase structure, rhythms, and harmonies come from? From<br>
which musical atoms am I building my piece? If they’re western, I’m<br>
shallowly following the culture I grew up in; if they’re from elsewhere, I<br>
could be distastefully appropriating a rich musical history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the chords interesting enough? Are they a copy of a well-known set of<br>
chord changes, e.g. “the four chords,”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> or are they just<br>
rhythm changes?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> If they’re not, but they’re close, should they<br>
be?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who is my audience?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do I want the listener to think or feel?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How should it be structured? Like a fugue?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> A rock song, with a<br>
melody and a chorus? An “AABA” jazz song?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> Like an EDM song with a<br>
drop? How much repetition should there be? Do I even know musical<br>
structure well enough to compose myself? Should I first listen to and<br>
analyze more music?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions multiply as you actually develop an artifact.</p>
<h2>Interlude</h2>
<audio preload="auto" controls>
 <source src="/website-3/assets/posts/paralysis/clarinet.mp3"
         type="audio/mp3">
</audio>
<h2>A recursive process</h2>
<p>The trouble I have with thinking dissectively is that I find it satisfying. It<br>
feels satisfying in exactly the way that collecting objects feels satisfying.<br>
From the vast, floating, endless clouds of knowledge, you begin to neatly pluck<br>
pieces of information, giving them names, organizing them in nice bookshelves,<br>
shuffling around your collections. Some things you might not be sure of, so you<br>
have them depend on other things, hedge your belief on them, or perhaps attach a<br>
sticky note to them that says “hypothetical.”</p>
<p>This satisfaction grows the more you dissect. Down you go, deeper and deeper,<br>
way down.</p>
<p>Learning is also safe. Are you a perfectionist? I don’t know whether I am. But<br>
I know that by learning, I don’t have to create, and without creating, I can’t<br>
make something bad or wrong or stupid or inadequate or accidentally a copy of<br>
something else.</p>
<p>Learning feels good. It’s hard to argue that it’s wrong. But if your goal is to<br>
produce creatively, then it’s not the point.</p>
<h2>Brutalism</h2>
<p><img src="/website-3/assets/posts/paralysis/deltas.jpg" alt="The harsh, repeating lines of the outside of a brutalist parking structure."></p>
<p class="figcaption attribution" markdown="1">

</p>
<p>A friend<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup> and I recently started talking about Brutalism.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup> I’d never<br>
known it by its name, only as “that horrible thing that happened to<br>
architecture around the '50s.” There are a few brutalist buildings around<br>
Seattle. I didn’t like them.</p>
<p>Spurred on by amateur Brutalist discussions (could you make a Brutalist website?<br>
is the programing language C++ Brutalist?), I decided to actually read a bit<br>
about Brutalism.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup> A few ideas stuck out to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>raw</li>
<li>distinct functional areas</li>
<li>honesty</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven’t seen the word “simplicity” used. But the idea is there. It made me<br>
start to think about design, space, sound, color, feeling, and complexity.</p>
<h2>Interlude</h2>

</div>
<h2>Learning <em>vs</em> creating</h2>
<p>The years I’ve spent trying to learn about creative outlets haven’t actually<br>
helped me produce creatively.</p>
<p>The misconception that learning would help with creativity is understandable.<br>
Start an activity and, especially if you’ve ever seen a professional do it, you<br>
realize there’s a lot to learn. And as long as you keep producing work, learning<br>
about and analyzing your craft <em>will</em> help you. Digging into the process and<br>
products of an expert will give you fresh ideas, help you push past conceptual<br>
blocks, and inspire you with what is possible.</p>
<p>But learning can also intimidate you. Learning about something unearths a<br>
mountain of complexity. You feel that you’re never ready to produce. How could<br>
you be? There’s so much past work to consume, digest, process, organize, and<br>
understand, how could you ever do all that and then, confidently and<br>
competently, extend the art with a deft stroke of your own contribution?</p>
<h2>Simplicity <em>via</em> Brutalism</h2>
<p>Watching the above video (<em>Brutalist Music</em>) triggered something, and I started<br>
to understand one way forward: explicitly abandon learning, dissection, and<br>
knowledge in favor of creating. Strip away the burdens you’ve created for<br>
yourself to participate in the creative process. If you’re a photographer,<br>
maybe you could abandon color, pick a single object in the world to shoot, fix<br>
a perspective and lens, and play only with light. I wanted to compose music, so<br>
I started by abandoning rhythm, melody, phrasing, chords, and what I’ve learned<br>
of jazz and classical music. I just started creating notes and listening to the<br>
sounds, thinking about harmonics, overtones, and the texture of pitch.</p>
<p>From this simplicity, I found myself free to experiment. I no longer expected<br>
myself to produce something great, so I was free to produce something,<br>
anything.</p>
<p>My advice, more to myself than anyone else, is: if you feel paralyzed by the<br>
complexity of what you want to pursue, explicitly discard swaths of what you<br>
(think you) know about it until you have a raw, functional, honest, simple idea<br>
to try. Then begin.</p>
