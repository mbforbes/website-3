We spent three weeks visiting cities we hadn't seen before in France. (Okay, plus Paris.)
Top priorities were to taste food and drink sun.


## Montpellier

Great vibes in Montpellier. I loved the dense streetcar network and plentiful outdoor public spaces (more on that below). It felt uncrowded and relaxed.

Lovely indoor rock climbing. Seattle Bouldering Project (our local gym) had a marvelous big cafe inside that I frequented for both morning caffeination and post-climb beer, but it had been closed from the start of Covid through when we left Seattle in March, 2022. I missed it a lot.

### French Parks are Weird

We came across a few parks like this one:

<div class="full-width flex justify-center ph1-m ph3-l fig">
<img class="db bare novmargin" src="{{ "/assets/blog/france/mp-park.moz80.jpg" | url }}" style="max-height: min(100vh, 939px);">
</div>

It's a bit hard to tell just from this photo alone, but the whole park is just fields of (patchy, dying) grass with trees planted in an exact grid.
The rows of trees thing made the parks feel alien. We never saw anyone hanging out in them.

Then again, other parks were great, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Food

I think I came to a realization about food.

When we say, _"oh the X is so good in Y,"_ like
- Oh, the sushi is so good in Japan
- Oh, the pizza is so good in NYC
- Oh, the wine / cheese / baguettes are so good in France

... I had always felt a bit confused, because, if you look for it, you can find amazing sushi, pizza, and wine / cheese / baguettes in a lot of places.
E.g., I think you can find all of those things in Seattle at a quality level that would rival all but the best establishments elsewhere.

But I was missing the point.

The point isn't whether you _can_ find it, it's
1. how easy it is to find
2. how good it is at the average place
3. and how cheap it is.

E.g., I am freshly completely and utterly blown away by baguettes in France.
1. baguette-selling bakeries are EVERYWHERE
2. the average baguette is EXTREMELY GOOD
3. and a baguette is $1.32 EVERYWHERE

This is madness.

If you try to buy quality bread in Seattle,
1. You must find one of the specialty boutique bakeries like Bakery Nouveau or Sea Wolf
2. At the average place (Safeway? QFC?) the baguettes range from okay to miserable
3. For a quality baguette, Bakery Nouveau will hit you for $4.25, or Sea Wolf for $4.20 (both over 3x the French price)

The situation is worse for something like a sourdough, which can set you back $12.50 (and rising) in Seattle.

Enough about baguettes.
But before I let you go, the same thing is true about cheese and wine.
After finding out a restaurant we wanted to go to didn't exist (/ was under renovation / something Google Maps didn't know about), we went to the average, run-of-the-mill grocery store and put together a cheese / meat board with cheap, basic stuff that was wildly, murderously delicious.
Not because we are gifted.
Because the cheap average thing is just that good.

Also here's an odd one.

<p class="figcaption">
At first I was like, WTF is a calzone taco.

</p>



### Public Spaces

French cities join Spanish ones in the ranks of places with enviable big public hangout areas.

I think the closest we have in The States are parks, but it's a whole thing if you want to bring coffee or food there, and you're not supposed to drink.

Big French extended plazas offer some hybrid of
- caf√©s (w/ food, coffee, beer)
- pleasant zones (fountains, mini parks)
- steps (good for sitting & hanging in evenings)
- generally nice architecture (somehow makes things much nicer than, e.g., a strip mall)

They're full of people, which also immediately makes them feel safe.

<div class="ml1-m ml3-l mr1-ns mb1 mb0-ns">

## Aix-en-Provence

<div style="background-color: #FCEEE1" class="full-width fig">
<img class="content-width" src="{{ "/assets/blog/france/aix-en-provence-france-3-perimeter.moz80.jpg" | url }}">
</div>

Just call it "Aix," pronounced like the letter X.

I felt like I didn't quite connect with Aix.

It's hard to judge cities when so much of one's experience is coincidences: who you know, who you meet, what you do, what happens (or doesn't) when you visit all of the locations you do.

With that said, I think you can get a sense of how approachable a city is to an outsider with your own priorities.

Anyway, more on that whole topic some other time. Aix had a gazillion fountains and a lovely outdoor food market near where we stayed.

### Interlude on Using Google Translate in The Wild

"Machine translation is solved," they say. "... at least for easy language pairs," they add.

Traveling around places where I either barely or don't understand the language has made me realize how much context you need to translate things well.

For example, if you're trying to pay the bill in Spanish, you learn that you do this by saying _la cuenta._

If you ask Google Translate how to say "the bill" or "the check," it will tell you:

<div class="full-width flex flex-wrap flex-nowrap-ns justify-center fig">
<div class="ml1-m ml3-l mr1-ns mb1 mb0-ns">
<img class="db bare novmargin ba b--black-10" src="{{ "/assets/blog/france/gt-the-bill.moz80.jpg" | url }}" style="max-height: min(100vh, 319px);">
</div>
<div class="mr1-m mr3-l">
<img class="db bare novmargin ba b--black-10" src="{{ "/assets/blog/france/gt-the-check.moz80.jpg" | url }}" style="max-height: min(100vh, 319px);">
</div>
</div>

You need to add "please" on there for it to understand what your intent is:

<img class="ba b--black-10" src="{{ "/assets/blog/france/gt-the-bill-please.moz80.jpg" | url }}" style="max-height: min(100vh, 319px);">

Here's one from France. We saw this bus painted with a huge _le car._

<div class="full-width flex justify-center ph1-m ph3-l fig">
<img class="db bare novmargin" src="{{ "/assets/blog/france/aix-le-car.moz80.jpg" | url }}" style="max-height: min(100vh, 500px);">
</div>

What does that mean?

<img class="ba b--black-10" src="{{ "/assets/blog/france/gt-le-car.moz80.jpg" | url }}" style="max-height: min(100vh, 319px);">

Yes, very intuitive France, thanks. But try going the other way:

<img class="ba b--black-10" src="{{ "/assets/blog/france/gt-the-bus.moz80.jpg" | url }}" style="max-height: min(100vh, 319px);">

Wonderful.

Now, Google Translate does have a great feature where you can see alternate translations.
However, it doesn't always show them to you.
You seem to need to come up with specific incantations to see them.
If you provide "the bus"---which you might think to do for languages like Spanish or French that love having words like "the" before nouns---it won't give you any other options.
But, if you just write "bus," then below, you'll see other options:

<img class="ba b--black-10" src="{{ "/assets/blog/france/gt-bus.moz80.jpg" | url }}" style="max-height: min(100vh, 598px);">

The frequencies are a great touch (though unfortunately they don't show up on the iPhone app).

It's funny, when you're working on NLP,[^nlp] you just want to focus on getting good data, using cool models, and getting good scores. It's annoying when people come by and say stuff like _(pushes glasses up on face) "actually, machine translation is really a human interface problem, if you think about it. We've done user studies that show..." (machine learning person zones out here)._

[^nlp]: NLP = Natural Language Processing, the field that underlies the study of topics like machine translation, AKA Google Translate.

But they're right. Actually _using_ NLP is all about context. Once you try using one of these things on the ground, you see how much intent matters. What are you trying to achieve? Are you trying to pay your tab at a restaurant, or are you asking about a parking ticket? Are you trying to ask when the bus comes, or are you just curious about when a French person would use _le bus_ vs _le car?"_

### Wine Growing Countryside

We took a bus like an hour east out of Aix to try to walk up a mountain and do wine tasting at a winery.

The mountain's fire risk was apparently high enough they'd closed the whole thing off, so we just walked through a bunch of fields. They seemed awful like people's property, but AllTrails said it was cool.

<div class="full-width flex justify-center ph1-m ph3-l figtop mb1">
<img class="db bare novmargin" src="{{ "/assets/blog/france/aix-country-wide.moz80.jpg" | url }}" style="max-height: min(100vh, 939px);">

<img class="db bare novmargin" src="{{ "/assets/blog/france/aix-country-walking.moz80.jpg" | url }}" style="max-height: min(100vh, 939px);">
</div>

It turned out the winery was more of a "try before you buy" kinda situation. So more interested in wholesale purchasers and less in providing a leisurely afternoon with accoutrements etc. We hurriedly gulped our sample glasses under the frequent gaze of the single woman on duty in the warehouse front room, bought a bottle (cheap! no regrets!), and went out to wait for the bus back in the boiling shade.

### Domino's in ~~France~~ Europe is Terrible

OK, look, I'm not even going to defend this one. We tried Domino's pizza in France.

But hear me out, there's a certain wonder to truly hot Domino's in the USA, with their oregano corn starch dusting and puffy crusts and plentiful molten cheese.

The flavors in France are at least interesting, so we were cautiously optimistic:

<div class="full-width flex flex-wrap flex-nowrap-ns justify-center fig">
<div class="ml1-m ml3-l">
<img class="db bare novmargin" src="{{ "/assets/blog/france/dominos-1.moz80.jpg" | url }}" style="max-height: min(100vh, 500px);">

<div class="mh1-ns mv1 mv0-ns">

<img class="db bare novmargin" src="{{ "/assets/blog/france/dominos-3.moz80.jpg" | url }}" style="max-height: min(100vh, 500px);">
</div>
</div>

<p class="figcaption">
I am impressed by that they had so many interesting and weird cheeses at freaking Domino's.
Imagine one in the US offering blue cheeses on the pizza.
"Kebab" flavor odd but somehow appropriate.
Side note: there seems to be some obsession here with plating anything with sauce using those big frantic squiggles over the whole area.
I thought we outgrew that as a society.
</p>

The result, dear reader, was bad. Okay, did we eat the whole thing anyway, maybe. But we won't do it again.

I updated the title above to Europe because Domino's in the UK appears equally bad.

Let me offer some photos from Domino's itself to demonstrate the difference.

USA Domino's is its own food genre, in the same way that Taco Bell is not Mexican Food, it is its own thing. Their pizza is not "New York pizza" or anything like that.
It's more like a particularly good formula of cheesy bread.

![]({{ "/assets/blog/france/dominos-usa.moz80.jpg" | url }})

</p>

Europe Domino's on the other hand seems to be trying to go more "classic pizza."
One hypothesis is that people here are used to pizza looking a certain way, and the thing on the top wouldn't be pizza to them. So instead you end up with:

This thought I keep having when we come across really beautiful public areas like this is: do people who grow up here think it's totally wild that they have this amazing, elaborate, ornate many-tier fountain / arch / promenade thing, right in the middle of their city, for anyone to use?
And the answer I can't help guess is: no, they probably think it's just normal. So then, any other place they go that doesn't have something like this... does it just seem totally run-down?

### European Churches

I had a new realization about how to approach European Churches that has been serving me well.

The realization is this: you shouldn't research them ahead of time or go out of your way too much to see them. But if you stumble upon one, and you feel like it, check it out.

Context: Years ago I got completely and utterly sick of looking at European churches. Maybe it's because I was a decade younger, or maybe it's because I just saw too many too close together, but they got to be so boring.

Before going on this trip, I even made Julie promise, hey, we are _not_ going to look at a bunch of damn churches. Or you can and I'll wait outside.

But now that we're here, it's like we'll be walking along the street, and suddenly, _holy crap, that building is enormous, and totally beautiful._

Then, you go inside, and your eyes start melting from the fractal details carved & painted into a thousand surfaces everywhere you look.

</div>

I think the trick is that I'm walking around so much looking at and staying in "normal" (boring, ultra plain) buildings, that coming across a big ornate church is like an information overload bomb of scale and detail and beauty.

Or honestly maybe I'm just old now.

Lyon was my favorite French city we visited. I would love to go back.

The city is beautiful---w/ the river Rh√¥ne running right through it---and it's got truly lovely parks and amazing food.

There were a bunch of shops near where we stayed that seemed like DIY craft spaces / teaching halls. This one is for making your own beer. We also saw ones for pottery, clothes making, and painting.
It made me think a bit about the value of having places for artists, and how challenging this is to maintain when a city gets really expensive, and how sad it is when that fails (see, e.g., Seattle for all of the above).
I have no reason to believe that Lyon has solved this. But seeing how many places there were for newbies to take classes made me wonder about that as a model for providing income and studio space for practitioners.

I have no photography training (as I am sure you can easily tell from looking at this blog), so I sometimes feel like I'm slowly learning by doing everything wrong. E.g., I noticed that all of my photos of this park look... I don't know, somehow off. Like the lighting is bad.
Which is weird, because the sun was extremely bright, and there was like no cloud cover. My recent thought: I wonder if direct overhead lighting is bad? It's like, "too harsh," or something like that? Maybe it's good to have shadowed areas that are more horizontal than vertical?

Lyon did something cool with Roman ruins: kept them and modernized them as a concert space. So you can attend a concert in an ancient Roman ampitheater. Way to go, guys. Apparently the Romans had also built a 90-ft tall wall behind the stage to... block off the whole amazing view of the city? Good call tearing that thing down.

### Photographing Art

I have two modes in museums:
1. Not photographing anything. Looking down at people who take photographs. "Just enjoy the art!" I think to myself. How foolish they are.
2. Photographing a bunch of stuff. "I want to remember, to be inspired later!" I think.

It's really impressive how bad the photos always are. In fact, they rarely even remind me what was so good about a piece.

To me, it's quite surprising that this is the case. You'd think, an image is an image, right? The scale and texture and physicality really matters, though, I think. Not to mention the whole designated space / mood for looking at them. Plus the context of an exhibition.

Anyway here's a few I took and some light commentary.

This is a prime example of photo not capturing what I liked about the piece.
The piece is printed on some special material... maybe layered enamel? The way light passed through the image just had beautiful optics to it.
Rendered as a photo, it just looks muddy.

## Paris

Relatively light report on Paris.

What struck me the most was basically any district we went to, there was a ton of good stuff.
Pleasant walks, nice cafes, interesting things to see and do, good subway connection.

I liked coming to Paris having been in smaller French cities for a few weeks.
Previously Paris was the first (and only) city I'd visit when coming to France.
Doing it this way definitely gave Paris a Manhattan vibe in contrast to the sleepier cities down south.

Quick story. My sister's husband proposed to her at the Eiffel Tower.
Someone nearby popped champagne and offered each of them a glass.
Overcome with emotion, they accepted.
The guy then demanded 80‚Ç¨ (~$85)!
(This was talked down.)
I kept wondering after hearing this story: are guys just walking around the Eiffel Tower with champagne, waiting for proposals to happen?
To my disbelief, the answer is freaking YES.
Multiple of these guys wandering around with buckets of ice and champagne (and wine, beer, cigarettes).
Judging by how many times we were offered wine, their business model is broader than just engagements.
