I just hit exactly the one year anniversary of starting to learn a new language: Japanese.

I started learning on exactly June 20, 2022. With a few exceptions, I spend 1.5 hours a day working on it, which means I've clocked 500-something hours of study so far.^[This ignores time spent talking to people and reading every sign I can out in the wild while in Japan.]

I've been stewing on several posts about the process for months.
But writing a real post takes time, and I've been constantly behind in travel writing, so I haven't done it yet.
I figured the one year mark would be a fun excuse to jot down my high level thoughts.

TODO: Insert progress pic.

## 1. Learning a language in your 30s is possible

I expected that it would be more difficult to learn a language in my 30s.
But I was worried it might be impossible.

I'm pleased to say that it is supremely possible. With some amount of shock, I discovered myself retaining dozens, then hundreds, of new words and characters.

However, for me, the process has required considerable strictness. The reason is that my memory no longer absorbs rapidly and robustly. The two tricks of forced memory---mnemonics and spaced-repetition---are vital. But what I notice more than my previous language learning is that I have to stick to them.

If I learn something without a mnemonic, it might take one or two dozen times to stick. And if I miss reviews, it's as if I never learned something at all.

## 2. Thinking about "fluency" as a separate stage

At some point along the way, I came up with a mental model for non-native language acquisition. This is nothing scientific, just how it feels to me.^[Likely people who study language learning---would these be linguists? or people in education or cognitive science?---actually know something about this.]

My mental model is this: there are two stages to learning any unit of language: word, phrase, conjugation, grammatical structure, and so on.

1. Acquisition
2. Fluency

**Acquisition** is like building your own personal physical dictionary. You can find something in it, but it's slow. When you hear a word, it might take you ten seconds to remember what it means. A computer analogy would be accessing something from the hard drive---it's slow, but it's there.

**Fluency** is a subset of what you've gathered during acquisition that is available at the speed of conversation. You can understand it when it's spoken with minimal delay, and you can reply with it.^[For me, and I think for most second-language speakers, my listening fluency and spoken fluency are different subsets of what I've acquired. As a beginner, I find my listening fluency is so bad that my speaking fluency is higher. I think that at intermediate levels, this switches, and your listening fluency outpaces your speaking.] A computer analogy is RAM or even cache memory---it's a smaller set, but it's available quickly.

I never made this conceptualization when studying the last two languages I'd worked on---Spanish and German. I'd never needed to. I'm not sure why. Perhaps they're similar enough to English that I never experienced large comprehension delays. Or it might be that I was just younger. But whatever the case, I found myself often reaching for a Japanese word I was sure I knew for one, five, or even ten seconds. At spoken conversation pace, this make comprehension impossible.

The other key factor is my belief that fluency is best acquired through volume---listening, speaking, reading, and (the most painful) writing. Instead of trying to combine fluency and acquisition, I believe it's better to acquire, build the dictionary, and then let the patterns of natural usage dictate what becomes quickly accessible.

Thinking about language this way helped free me up from thinking that I wasn't quite _getting it._ At first I was worried that what I was learning wasn't sticking. But conceptualizing this split between acquisition and fluency helped me relax about drilling every basic thing into oblivion. This also matched advice I read from people further along than me: don't belabor what you learn, just get a grasp of it, and let volume do the fluency work.^[A big caveat to this is that I am not remotely fluent in any second language. So it's quite early, and perhaps naive, for me to have these beliefs. I really need to seek out some second language-acquirers and ask them how it felt for them.]

## 3. Communication is a whole different ballgame

I thought that I was doing OK at getting speaking practice. When they came up in my text book or any flash card, I would say individual words and sentences and phrases. My pronunciation isn't perfect, but I think it is passable.

Cue a bulldozer dose of humility when we arrive in Japan, I've got about ten months of practice under my belt, and I can't understand anything. Not even numbers, not even words and phrases I know.

It's not that the accents were thick---the accents were fine. It's not that it was too fast---the speed was normal. And it wasn't that I didn't know the words---though every conversation quickly plunged into impossible territory as we barreled past my puny vocab.

It's something that I think is what people call stage fright. I've never experienced stage fright before, but yeah, I think this is it. My brain just could not keep up, could not parse sounds into words. And I could not produce the simplest of sentences. A single number would take me upwards of seven seconds to turn into arabic numerals in my head. All my verb conjugations got reduced to nothing.

Keep in mind, too, this is with some of the most polite and patient people you could hope to interact with.

I think the other factor is that my fluency was quite a bit lower than I'd thought it was. When listening to passages from my textbook---which are carefully selected to contain only words that I know---I would have to listen multiple times. In real life, you don't get that. And while I could read phrases or sentences out loud, _composing_ them on the fly is much more challenging.

So yeah, this was shocking and humbling.^[One thing I did do that seriously paid off was to explicitly study service-oriented language. Stuff like reservations, being asked to wait, asking to order, asking for the bill. Due to a whole bunch of stuff about Japanese that I don't understand well enough to really write about, there's a whole formality system that turns stuff you think you should know upside down, so it was extremely helpful to drill that al before arriving.]

## 4. Focus on lifelong learning

I've seen several different charts on how long different languages take to learn. Of course, it depends on which language you start with---Spanish&rarr;Italian is going to be easier than Chinese&rarr;Italian.

But for Japanese, at least for me at my age and abilities,^[I am not a gifted language learner by any remote stretch of the imagination.] it has to be a long game.

I mean, I'm glad I tried. I gave it my damndest for ten months before we actually got to go to Japan. But I can't even make it through a slightly-off-rail service interaction before getting hopelessly lost.

It's easy to get motivated for some short term herculean push. I did before. I actually tried some Japanese several years ago. You see this all the time in apps, like Wanikani,^[Wanikani is a Japanese education app to teach you vocabulary and the Chinese characters used in the language.] where people are trying to move as fast as possible, loading themselves up with as much content as they can for a handful of weeks until they burn out.

Even just switching from a "what can I do in a year" to "what can I do in ten years" mindset is very helpful. Because the truth is, unless you have some advantage,^[Advantages I can think of: you know a similar language, you live there, you're young, you can spend huge amounts of time studying, you're gifted at learning languages.] a language takes time. And if it's more difficult to acquire, it's going to take more hours than you can keep up short-term burst motivation.

This means you have to cool off the fire into a slow burn, and you have to commit to it being a part of your daily life for the indefinite future. This is a massive commitment. It is difficult to overstate. It must come above other things you could do with your life. I think most people have room for only one, _maybe two_ things like these. Like, going to the gym, or learning a language, or writing a novel---that kind of thing. Pick one. It's a serious opportunity sacrifice.

Not being realistic about this choice is certain doom. Because if you can't last, you will not succeed.

The upside is that if you put in the time, it is supremely doable. It is completely possible to acquire ten or twenty new things a day. And the fluency, while building slowly, is definitely building. So, you can get there.

## 5. Google Translate Will Never Suffice

Machine translation like Google Translate.
