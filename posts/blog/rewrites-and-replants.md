What I've been up to:

- I rewrote my website from Jekyll/Liquid into Eleventy/Nunjucks. It was somewhat painful and tedious, but I'm excited now because I feel much more comfortable building new additions onto it. I hope to write a post about the misery of template languages.

- Seeking a join task + calendar app. I have a semi-coherent draft of a post written about this.

- Several days reading the IRS tax code. I might have Stockholm syndrome, but it seems pretty well-written?

- I've been going through my parents' old records. We repotted our plants to Stevie Wonder's _Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants_, a 2-vinyl saga. This went great until I realized dirt-covered hands makes for miserable record flipping.

- Getting ready to leave Seattle and most possessions behind and start traveling. A thousand little logistics.

- I discovered Picross and have spent many enjoyable hours on its puzzles.
