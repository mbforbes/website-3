We were looking forward to being home. We didn’t expect this to happen.

Homesickness didn’t ever really hit us. But both times I was headed back—for a wedding in May, and now for a month and a half in late December—I could feel the anticipation building for a few days before.

Friends! Family! Familiar comforts, cultural fitting in-ness, the immediate nostalgia of the last phases of our lives.

Now, wandering the empty streets of the neighborhood where I grew up, barely a week back, I had the strangest feeling.

I wanted to leave.

Here’s the best way I can try to rationalize it.

First, the anticipation was imagining my life before we left. We had our own apartment, which we loved—spacious, full of plants we’d named, our favorite things. Tools for our hobbies and interests at the ready. We were fresh off of topping off disposable income. Restaurants and coffee shops we knew and adored were nearby. We had Seattle’s only metro line (the “light rail”) a few blocks away, and were in the center of the city.

Trade that for sleeping in the guest bedroom of your parents’ house. Artifacts of literal past lives (i.e., your grandmother’s) beside you. There’s the inevitable reversion-to-teenage relations with your parents (from talking to friends’ this is surprisingly universal, and is still a bizarre phenomenon to me). There’s the simple change in autonomy of living in someone else’s home—they know when you wake up, when you go to sleep, and you tell them when you’re going out and for how long and where (not out of some obsessive controlling, but it does feel polite when you’re being hosted). Your favorite things are in boxes in the attic, where you occasionally go fishing for a second pair of shoes or a treasured coffee mug.

And suburbia, its flat gray emptiness on the edge of town, is isolating after being swept up in major metropolisses. The comfort of nostalgia battles with the blank stare of empty streets—moss-covered signs, sparse towering pines, trucks in disrepair. The occasional 30-something walking couple in technical gear you don’t say hi to. The occasional 50-something dog-walker you do. A neighborhood just sprawling enough you always wonder, should I know you?

It’s the experience of a transduced home, not yours, a transposed life, not yours. A waiting period, all comforts scalene in their adjacency, foreign and familiar and wrong. Doubt creeps into the heart. You want to run and assert your own power to control your environment, plow ahead with your destiny. And instead you’re left typing a stupid moody manifesto on the couch in the TV room to escape your well-intentioned dad interrupting you every ninety seconds by narrating each GIF he comes across on tumblr. (Sorry dad, very grateful for your decades of sacrifice for my wellbeing, it’s the whole ungrateful teenager reversion thing happening, really.)
