My last memories of Europe are strong and fond. I spent a year in Zurich, Switzerland as a student in college. I made so many friends—both locals and transplants—studied and worked in the city at various times, and did my damndest to learn the local language.[^lang]

[^lang]: For those of you familiar with Swiss German, this is a complex undertaking. I really just learned high (AKA “standard” AKA “Germany”) German and reveled in the few Swiss words I picked up.

It’s jarring now to visit a city (Lisbon, Portugal) that brings back potent European vibes, but as a complete outsider.[^outsider]

[^outsider]: Writing this now, I'm reminded that being an outsider is a fractal. My feeling after a year in Switzerland was that if I'd stayed and worked my whole life at it, I'd always remain an outsider. The degree and nature just change. A friend there said it best: "All it takes is the slightest emphasis on the wrong syllable and you know: they're not truly from here." This gave me mad respect for everyone who immigrates to another country. Tenfold if you can't obviously pass---after all, I felt this as a European-looking guy.

I made a list of what struck me the first few days in Lisbon:

- Cobblestone everything — streets, sidewalks, paths
- Narrow winding roads always intersecting at odd angles
- Universally ~4-story buildings
- Due to the street width _vs_ building height ratio, there’s rarely direct sunlight in all but arterials
- Cars drive unbelievably fast in the available space. Passing others on sidewalk requires going into the street. A stupid death feels readily available.
- Due to narrow streets and omnipresent cars, constant smell of gasoline.

- Teaming abundance of tourists. For a surprising radius in the city. Locals must hate us. I would.
- Portuguese sounds like Spanish mixed with Russian. Reads very similar to Spanish.
- Old men greeting locals with grumpy barks. They like it. Or each other with hugs.
- Portuguese chain smoking by empty beer glasses at cafes without any signs, with plain tables crammed together in a single whitewashed rectangular room. These are local joints.

- Egg tarts are dangerously as good as everyone said they would be.
- Every meal out has been well-salted and well-cooked. Subtle herbs and spices, pleasant, difficult to pinpoint.
- It’s so cheap.

… but I still have no idea what this place is **actually like**.

Without knowing locals, and without speaking the language, it feels like you can go a mile wide and still only make it an inch deep. I’ve been eating and seeing and doing for a week, and I don’t feel like I’m making forward progress.

Anyway, just a tiny woe---and one obvious in hindsight---to accept. Good impetus to find old friends and make new ones. And overall, it has been lovely here.
