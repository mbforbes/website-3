D.C. felt vibrant and friendly in a your-favorite-block-in-NYC kinda way. Plus this kind of New England brick urban/suburban charm. (Probably my architecture references are off, hopefully you get the idea.)

Anyway wow, super nice city. It's funny it seems to often take me a few visits (= random samples) to get a sense of a place. The last time I'd come to D.C., I was mostly on my own, didn't really know where to go. Saw Georgetown and handful of tourist sights. Hanging with locals (thank you, A&B!) is wonderful.
