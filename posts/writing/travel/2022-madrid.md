We popped by Madrid for a couple days.

We both liked Madrid much more than we expected! I'm not sure why we thought we wouldn't like it---big, not near water, likely huge swarms of tourists. But it turned out to be:

- Big in a good way: bustling with new restaurants and shops, and large enough to handle the volume of tourists. It didn't feel over-crowded.

- Pleasantly laid out, in kind of Washington, D.C. Ã— NYC way: big avenues and long parks, but also densely packed districts.

Despite a metro system, we ended up walking everywhere.

## Big & Small

I was expecting to finally be able to dial in my taste: do I prefer big cities or small towns?

I'm coming to realize that I don't prefer one exclusively, but like bouncing between them. When I get to a small town from a big one (or vice versa), I'm excited by the spaciousness (or density), variety (or simplicity), infrastructure (or quiet).

In a way this is good, but I'm jealous of people who can say, "oh, I could _only_ live in a place like _X"_ and seem to know it.
