Penang is a state of Malaysia, but also the name of the island (left side of the detailed map). We stayed on the island the whole time.

I was interested to learn a bit more about Malaysia. My last visit was nine years ago. I knew it as a mixture of Malay, Indian, and Chinese people, with an incredible food scene you might guess from such a combination. But this time, I got to hear a bit mor about the ethnic tensions---political parties drawn between racial and religious boundaries and difficulties with corruption.

This post will be mostly a photo collage, and light on commentary. Enjoy the scroll.

Some filming locations of _Crazy Rich Asians_ are in Penang, like the _Blue Mansion_ (mahjong scene), and the _Eastern & Oriental Hotel_ (opening scene).

One thing Penang taught me is you can't just have density, you also need public transportation. They seemed to have nailed the density thing---massive condos erupted all along the north shore. But the poor roads couldn't handle it. We regularly sat in an hour of traffic.

<p class="figcaption">Also, check out how long that bridge is.</p>

You can also see (what looks to be) reclaimed land being created.

<p class="figcaption">It's always baffled me why it's called "reclaimed." Seems like "invented" would be a better word.</p>

## Food

Malaysia is lauded by many,^[In Singapore, any mention of Penang universally garnered a wistful sigh of, "Oooh, the food..."] including myself, as a food lover's dream destination.
This trip, I had some of the best Chinese food I've ever eaten, and developed a serious craving for the flavor of _salted egg_.

In the fried food stall (second photo), note that 1.80 Malaysian Ringgit is currently $0.41 US.

Oh, and I can't forget the obligatory interesting product pics.
