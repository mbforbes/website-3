  <p class="f2">ROT Breakdown: Batch Feedback</p>
  <p class="f4">
    I'm experimenting with something new for this HIT: radical transparency!
    <br /><br />
    As part of this, I want to make all of my batch feedback messages available to you.
    <br /><br />
    People who work on a task for many batches accumulate knowledge from many rounds
    of group feedback. I thought it might be helpful for anyone to be able to read all
    of that feedback at any time.

    <p class="f4">
    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
    <p>A couple quick questions answered before this evening batch! These are relevant for the
      domain we've been working on lately, so I hope they might help you out.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> It seems like a lot of these don't have a clear person who is targeted? It
          seems like the narrator is giving advice to someone. For example, take the situation
          "Take Simple Steps to Avoid Delays at Doctor's Office," and the ROT "It's good to plan
          ahead to make sure you have everything you need when going to an appointment." Who do
          we pick as the ROT targeting?</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer:</strong> These situations are from Dear Abby. So, the “narrator” isn’t really
            well-defined. The person giving the advice is Abby, so the ROT probably isn’t
            targeting her. (No one gives advice to Abby!) The ROT is (often) also targeting
            the person she’s giving advice to. So, all that to say, "no one listed” is the
            best answer for situations like that!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> What moral foundation do we pick for ROTs about having freedom to do what you
          want? For example, "you don't have to go to the movies," or "it's ok to have an
          opinion," or "it's ok to like rap music?"</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer:</strong> These really fall under a sixth moral foundation: “liberty /
            oppression.”I should have included it, but I didn’t (facepalm). So, please don’t
            mark any moral foundations if you believe it falls into that category! Some
            workers have asked me about whether this would be “authority,” but I think that’s
            not quite a good fit here. I think of "authority" when there’s more clearly
            someone else with more/less power involved.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> I would love to have an example for (moral foundations for) a racism related
          ROT. For some reason these throw me off on whether racism is unfair, harmful, imposing
          authority over people, etc.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer:</strong> That's a great question. I think you could easily argue that it falls
            in all of those categories. You should mark all of those that come to mind for
            you. To be honest, most examples of moral foundations I've seen deal with
            pathologically simple examples, so they don't have a clear guideline for something
            as complex as racism. I'd argue you should mark all the ones you listed,
            especially because racism affects people differently, and brings potentially
            different moral issues to mind.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> I would also love an example of an ROT dealing with Sanctity (not degradation).
          I'm always unsure about this one. For example, would murder be violating the sanctity
          of life. Having a sanctity example might help clarify this a lot.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer:</strong> Sanctity is also a hard one for me, because it doesn't seem like a
            value that I (personally) encounter about much in daily life. Another way of
            thinking about sanctity that might be more helpful is "purity." Your example about
            life fits. Other things that come to mind are things people like to keep pure — a
            shrine, the minds of children, or something special to them: their body, their
            relationship, and items or places associated with religion.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thanks everyone! Have a nice evening!</p>

    <p class="f3">Email message</p>
    <p class="f4">
    <p>Hi all, another quick feedback message,</p>
    <p>I sent individual feedback to some of you. Overall, thank you to everyone for your
      amazing hard work, these batches have been going great! I hope this week is treating you
      well so far!</p>
    <p>A few small clarifications I thought I'd post to everyone:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Question: We should only mark something as "explicit" or "not explicit" if the exact
          wording is used in the sentence from the ROT, right? Not "wanting" or "trying to." I'm
          guessing that would be probable or hypothetical.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Answer: Yes (mostly)! The wording doesn't have to be an <em>exact</em> match for
            "explicit" or "not explicit," but it should be clear that they are definitely
            doing (or not doing) the action. For things like "wanting" or "trying to," yes,
            the correct box would be "probable" or "hypothetical" (depending on the
            specifics).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Question: I'm assuming Social Norms always involves others, correct? Meaning,
          something like "it's normal to go to the grocery store to do shopping" or "it's normal
          to eat breakfast every day" would just be "it is what it is," correct? I keep thinking
          when someone says "normal" it automatically means Social Norms.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Answer: That's tricky! Those are both essentially social norms. But they're also
            not very inter-human ones (which is what we're mostly focused on with the ROTs).
            For those, I'd think of "it is what it is" as the primary category, and "social
            norms" as the secondary one. (So I would mark both.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Question: Are we allowed to significantly re-word an ROT if we understand what it is
          saying, but we'd need to change it to make the action?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Answer: Yes, <em>please</em> do this! It's extremely helpful for me if you can take the
            extra time to sort these out. If you think it's possible but you don't want to,
            feel free to return the HIT and allow someone else to do it. I'd really prefer
            that to marking ones as "bad" unnecessarily! (With that said, of course, there are
            some truly incomprehensible ROTs, and it is OK to pass on those.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thank you everyone, and talk soon!</p>

    <p>ROT Breakdowns: ROT Categorization Examples (Finally!)</p>
    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
    <p>(You're receiving this email because you're qualified to work on the ROT Breakdown
      project.)</p>
    <p>I poured through a ton of your responses over the last couple batches. Great work!!
      We've been making incredible progress, the annotations are looking really good, and
      people are asking smart questions. Thank you so much for the effort you've been putting
      in, I really appreciate it!</p>
    <p>I wanted to focus this message on helping out with <em>ROT Categorization.</em> From my end, I
      think folks have been doing really well on this overall. But I think many of you would
      like a bit more guidance and clarification to feel confident in your work. So let's see
      if I can help!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Morality (/ ethics)</strong> has to do with what's "right" or "wrong", even if the ROT
          doesn't use those words. These are somewhat rare. Here are some recent ROTs I'd mark
          as morality/ethics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It's good to give people their lost items back</li>
          <li>It's understandable to be concerned when your 12 year old injects a needle into their veins.</li>
          <li>It is wrong to steal</li>
          <li>It's not okay to let yourself be used for other's gain.</li>
          <li>It's wrong to be greedy.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Social norms</strong> are about conventions we have. They often bleed into the
          "morality/ethics" and "advice" categories, so don't be afraid to mark both when that
          happens! Here are ROTs I'd mark as "social norms" (sometimes with another category):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you drop something, you should pick it up.</li>
          <li>It is reasonable to be upset if someone goes through your things.</li>
          <li>It is expected people will take a lot of pictures at special events.</li>
          <li>You should always support your friends when they have a new baby.</li>
          <li>(+ advice) It is good to show appreciation when someone does something nice for you.</li>
          <li>(+ advice) It's good to visit your partner's place.</li>
          <li>(+ advice) It's good to be concerned with how you look.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Advice</strong> is often mixed with social norms. In fact, it can be hard to imagine advice
          without some idea of how society operates. My rule-of-thumb (ha, ha) is to add "social
          norms" when the advice has to do with behavior between multiple people, or society's
          perceptions. Examples of advice:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You should always buy your favorite foods if they are on sale.</li>
          <li>You shouldn't trust cheaters.</li>
          <li>It's good to be responsible for your animals.</li>
          <li>(+ social norms) You should be independent.</li>
          <li>(+ social norms) It is nice to be supportive when someone is making a positive life change.</li>
          <li>(+ social norms) It's good to do things to make someone to feel special.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>It is what it is</strong> ROTs are about the way things are. I usually mark this if the ROT
          describes just how things are, and none of the other categories seem to be at play.
          Sometimes you have to ignore the judgment (e.g., "it's good") part of the ROT, because
          it can be misleading.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is annoying to feel powerless in a situation.</li>
          <li>It's good to take part in Medieval Times since it's a ton of fun eating there.</li>
          <li>It's good to adopt a new pet.</li>
          <li>It's normal for people to take vacations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's it from me for now. I hope you enjoy the final ROT batch for today, and have a
      great Friday evening!</p>
    <p>Max</p>

    <p>Quick feedback message in order to get the next batch out on time:</p>
    <p>I read through a bunch of your responses, and left some feedback where I could. I'll
      hope to get to more of you before the next batch! Things are looking really good
      overall, though!</p>
    <p>One common question I'm getting is about ROT Categorization. People would like me to
      post more examples! Especially for the wide range of ROTs we're experiencing right now.
      There's not enough time to do this before the next batch goes out, but I'll work on that
      ASAP! (I'm sorry it's been so long!)</p>
    <p>Thanks again, everyone! Talk soon, enjoy the next batch!!</p>

    </p>

    <p class="f3">Email message</p>
    <p class="f4">
    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
    <p>I wanted to answer a couple questions I've gotten recently before posting the next
      batch!</p>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> What do we do about vague ROTs that seem disconnected from the situation?
      For example, for the situation "I read the book you gave me," should we mark as bad the
      ROT "It is good to be yourself?"</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> As usual, I'd say the answer is "it depends!" Let me give two examples.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, an ROT like "It is good to be yourself" is actually relevant, like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Situation: "Following my passions despite what my boyfriend thinks"<ul>
          <li>ROT: "It's good to be yourself"</li>
          <li>good!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>... but on the other hand, sometimes the ROT is truly just a cop-out:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Situation: "I read the book you gave me"<ul>
          <li>ROT: "It's good to be yourself"</li>
          <li>trash!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>in those cases, it is OK to use the big button that marks the ROT as bad and move on!</p>
    <p>I would say if the ROT is relevant at all, keep it, but if it's just totally generic,
      feel free to mark it as bad!</p>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> What do we do about ROTs with "because" in them? For example "You
      shouldn't be broke, because then you can't pay your bills."</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> You can go either way on these. It's ideal if you can change the "because"
      into something that enriches the action. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ROT: You shouldn't be broke, because then you can't pay your bills.<ul>
          <li>Action: being broke and unable to pay your bills</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>... but it's also fine to remove the "because" for ones where it's difficult to
      naturally combine the ideas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ROT: Wanting to tie the knot, because life's short and brutal<ul>
          <li>Action: wanting to tie the knot</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> What do we do about ROTs with two actions in them? For example, "It's
      important to care for yourself and not be too hard on yourself."</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> For the two-action ROTs, if you can identify one clear action, please do
      that and keep them!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>ROT: It's important to care for yourself and not be too hard on yourself.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Action: taking care of yourself</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ROT: It's expected that children, not adults, like watching cartoons.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Action: children liking to watch cartoons</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ideally, we would be able to identify both actions in two separate breakdowns. But that
      will have to be left for a future project! :-)</p>
    <p>Thanks everyone!!</p>
    <p>Max</p>

    <p class="f3">Email message</p>
    <p class="f4">
    <p>Hi everybody,</p>
    <p>Happy Friday! Quick note as I'm hoping to get the next batch out ASAP:</p>
    <p>I've noticed that people are going REALLY FAST through these. It's great that we're so
      productive---and don't worry, I'm not going to lower the pay! BUT I've also noticed
      people getting a bit sloppy with some of these fields. We really need to make sure that
      the annotations are still good!</p>
    <p>Here are a few things I noticed spring up:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Choosing the same option every time for "how many people agree with this ROT?"</strong>
          It's totally fine to choose the same option if you really do feel the same way. But I
          noticed some folks picking the same option when ROTs seemed significantly more / less
          controversial.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Conjugating the action properly.</strong> If there are multiple verbs, it's important to
          conjugate both! For example, for an ROT like "It's wrong to break the law and drink
          while underage.", make sure to conjugate both BREAK and DRINK, so that the action is
          "breaking the law and drinking while underage"</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Be judicious when picking moral foundations.</strong> Many situations will have 0 or only 1
          moral foundation. Don't feel like you need to pick 1 or multiple for every ROT! It's
          better that we be a bit pickier here rather than trigger happy :-)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you'd like more examples for picking moral foundations, I wrote a bunch more in the
      "Extended feedback" section for the March 20 batch:
      https://maxwellforbes.com/social-chemistry/resources/rot-breakdown-feedback.html#200320</p>
    <p>In general, the work is looking good. And if you're already being careful with the above
      points, don't worry, and thank you! Just please help me out if you find yourself rushing
      through these!</p>
    <p>More from me today on the future schedule!</p>

    <p class="f4">
    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
    <p>Happy Friday!</p>
    <p>I wanted to send you an update on the status of the project.</p>
    <p>There is another batch incoming, which I'll release in a couple minutes after this
      email. That will be the only batch for today, and there will be no batches this weekend.</p>
    <p>This project has been going great, and I'm so grateful for the fantastic work you all
      have done. It's been an immense pleasure working with you.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the funding situation for this project is up in the air, and I don't know
      when it will be resolved.</p>
    <p>Here is my best guess for a timeline right now (all times US Pacific):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>today (3/27/20): 1 batch (immediately)</li>
      <li>this weekend (3/28/20 -- 3/29/20): no batches</li>
      <li>Monday (3/30/20): <em>hopefully</em> 1 or 2 batches (8-11am if 1, plus 6-8pm if 2)</li>
      <li>Tuesday (3/31/20): <em>hopefully</em> 1 or 2 batches (8-11am if 1, plus 6-8pm if 2)</li>
      <li>Wednesday (4/1/20) and beyond: ???</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Quals:</strong> I currently have a lot of requests from workers and referrals from you all to
      take the qual and join the project. I am thrilled for this interest, but we cannot run
      more quals until we're sure that the project will be able to continue. I hope this will
      happen as soon as possible, but I have no timeline on this.</p>
    <p>I will be crossing my fingers for many batches to come in the future, but only time will
      tell. I'll send an email to you all as soon as I know more long-term.</p>
    <p>I'll continue replying individually to emails as I can, but I apologize if my emails are
      delayed or short!</p>
    <p>Again, thank you all so much for your help so far. I hope you enjoy the batch today, and
      that you can find some time for fun and relaxation this Friday. Take care everyone.</p>

    <p class="f3">Email message</p>
    <p class="f4">
    <p>Happy Thursday everyone!</p>
    <p>Thank you for your hard work on the last few batches! More coming your way soon.</p>
    <p>I appreciate you all writing in your thoughts and commentary, both email and in the
      feedback box. I'm still reviewing HITs giving individual feedback. Some more of you
      should have gotten individual feedback today. If you haven't yet, hopefully in a batch
      soon :-)</p>
    <p>Here are a few more common things I spotted in reviewing HITs recently.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>For the ACTION, try to make sure it's phrased as something you can <em>do.</em> This usually
          means second person (you/your). For example, "looking at the clock" or "driving your
          car." So, for example, if we had an ROT like "parents paying attention to their
          children", we would NOT transcribe the action as "paying attention to their
          children". Instead, we have a couple main choices. One is "paying attention to your
          children" (second person). The other is "parents paying attention to their children"
          (third person). In general, I prefer the "your" as long as the action is super clear.
          (For this example, it's clear that "your children" implies you are a parent, so
          including "parent" is redundant. But other times, it does make sense to include the
          subject if it's not implied by the action.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Remember that "if" often turns into "when" for turning ROT into ACTION! E.g., for the
          ROT "It's good to use headphones if your music is loud", we would write the ACTION as
          "using headphones when your music is loud". This makes it more action-y.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you find yourself clicking the "&gt; 99%" agreement option all of the time, consider
          if this is really <em>totally</em> universal! Often it is, so I don't want to make everyone
          second-guess themselves. But in the last round, I saw a handful of folks using that
          choice for somewhat controversial ideas. Really consider if <em>everyone</em> would agree on
          that idea, or if sometimes people might think otherwise.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>That's all from me for now! Enjoy your day!</p>

      3/24/20 Batch 2
    </p>

    <p class="f3">Email message</p>
    <p class="f4">
    <p>Hey everyone,</p>
    <p>Super short update!</p>
    <p>People are going FAST. (But your work has still been looking solid so far!) I think most
      of us have acquainted to the task at this point.</p>
    <p>I ran the numbers again, and the target pay is now somewhere between $0.26 and $0.46 per
      HIT (for majority -- vast majority to make $15/hr). But, I want to account for people
      taking breaks and the potentially high mental load. And I and don't want people to feel
      rushed. So the HIT price will be set at $0.51.</p>
    <p>I hope this is OK with everyone! It breaks my heart every time I lower the HIT reward. I
      really want the pay to continue to be fair! Please keep sending along feedback.</p>
    <p>Thank you so much for your hard work (and for reading my feedback messages)! More
      individual feedback and examples coming in the following days. (And more batches!)</p>
    <p>Take care!</p>
    </p>

    <p class="f3">Email message</p>
    <p class="f4">
    <p>News: I hope everyone has been staying healthy and is doing all right!</p>
    <p>I have sent individual feedback to a dozen or two of you, and been looking over HITs
      from many more. If you haven't gotten individual feedback, I'm sorry! Hopefully in the
      future :-) But I'll try to at least keep sending out some group feedback.</p>
    <p>Overall, all of the annotations I've seen have been really good!! I've been super
      impressed with how focused and critical you all have been. Thank you so much for your
      hard work so far.</p>
    <p><strong>Update for power users: New CSS class available around inputs.</strong> For those of you who
      modify the HIT to your liking, I've made a change where there is now an <code>rot-input</code> CSS
      class around all <code>div</code> HTML elements that contain inputs (except for the "bad ROT" one,
      which is used rarely).</p>
    <p>Here's a few questions I've seen come up:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: The action is being done by multiple people. Which one should I pick?</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer: Try to pick the "best" person.</strong> Usually, even if the action applies
            to multiple people, there's a "primary instigator." Someone who is most clearly
            demonstrating the action. Often that will be the person the ROT is aiming for.
            So, try to pick them. If there's really, truly a tie, it's OK to choose either
            person! :-)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: I have deep experience in an area related to the ROT (e.g., I worked in an
            industry mentioned), and I'm worried my answers will be different. Should I return the
            HIT?</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer: No, please do them!</strong> Having expertise in an area is excellent. And
            it's <em>good</em> to have a diversity of opinions (more on that in a sec). The only
            advice I would give is to make sure you're answering for the "everyday" /
            "commonsense" interpretation of an ROT, rather than for extreme or special
            cases.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: Diversity of opinions is good? Then why did you send out that feedback
            that showed where we disagreed with others?</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer: I am hoping for consistent marking, but honest opinions!</strong> So my
            intent with that feedback was to make sure that folks are interpreting the
            instructions the same way, especially for tricker labeling, like Moral
            Foundations and ROT Categorization. But for your own opinions, I really do want
            you to be honest with what you think! I appreciate you all letting me know about
            that feedback, and I'll keep adjusting what I do in the future!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also, thank you for everyone who wrote to me about confusing or difficult situations.
      There were many questions especially about fine lines between "hypothetical" and
      "probable." I looked over many of these examples, and for all of them, you guys ended up
      rating the same way I would have. So please take heart in that, even if I wasn't able to
      respond to you individually!</p>
    <p>One last thing...</p>
    <p>COMPLETELY OPTIONAL SECTION FOLLOWS:
      I've been chatting with some of you about how interesting it is that some ROTs seem to
      have changed in the recent days / weeks with the Coronavirus. For example, one of the
      examples I wrote in the instructions for the "&lt; 1% (Almost no one)" agreement category
      is <em>"You should never leave your home"</em>. It sounded so utterly crazy at the time... but
      now?</p>
    <p>So, I thought it might be interesting for us to mark ROTs that may have changed in
      recent days. This could help us illustrate how the pandemic has affected our society,
      because some of our <em>underlying social norms</em> suddenly changed in a matter of days!</p>
    <p>So, COMPLETELY OPTIONAL: If you'd like, feel free to write "coronavirus" (no quotes) in
      the feedback box for any ROT that you think is affected by the Coronavirus.</p>
    <p>More HITs coming soon! Take care!</p>

    <p class="f3">Email message</p>
    <p class="f4">
    <p>Another update with some questions and feedback I got!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Update: We now have a "probably not" button!</strong> For cases where you think a character
          will <em>probably not</em> do the action listed in an ROT, you can select that box! However,
          you probably won't need it much. Check my answer to the final question below :-)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Update: More ROT Categorization examples coming early next week!</strong> I'm sorry about
          my delay on this. I expect to post more Monday. In the mean while, keep checking out
          the examples that are there, and marking as best you can!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: Should I try to mark what I think other people will mark?</strong> The individual
          feedback has compared me to others' responses, and I'm worried about answering
          differently!</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer: Please answer as you, personally, believe!</strong> The individual feedback was
            meant only to give you insight into how other people are answering in case you
            thought their answers made more sense. Don't worry about conforming, especially
            for personal judgments (e.g., "how much pressure do you feel?"). I'll take this
            into account as I roll out new individual feedback :-)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: How do I know if the narrator is the one doing the action?</strong> For example,
          take the situation, "not telling a friend she's getting fired from work." Is the
          narrator the one who has a friend, and is not telling her this?</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer: Please assume the narrator is the one doing the situation!</strong> So for this
            example, we'd imagine there's a narrator who is telling us: "hey, here's this
            thing I'm doing: not telling a friend she's getting fired from work."</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: How do we pick the judgment for "it is what it is" ROTs?</strong> For example,
          "People sometimes do things they shouldn't" or "People can get stressed out
          sometimes"?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Answer: Usually, "expected / OK" is the judgment for ROTs that are "it is what
                it is" statements.</strong> Some ROTs don't have a clear judgment written in them.
              Instead, some ROTs just say things that generally happen. In these cases, we'd
              probably pick the implicit judgment "expected / OK."</p>
            <p>For example, if an ROT says "People can get stressed out sometimes", you can
              think of that like someone saying "it's expected that people can get stressed
              out sometimes." So we'd say action = "people getting stressed out sometimes" and
              judgment = "it's expected". As for the graded judgment (where you pick a radio
              button), usually this is also "expected / OK".</p>
            <p>However, for some statements, you might pick a different choice. For example, in
              the ROT "People sometimes do things they shouldn't," we might say that this
              judgment is expected, but also slightly bad. So either choice is OK.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: A lot of the situations use the word "wanting", as in "not wanting to go
            to the store." For the last question (are they doing the action?) how should we be
            marking those, since they are saying they want or don't want to do something?</strong> Should
          we assume they actually did / didn't do it, or mark it as hypothetical / probable?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Answer: For "not wanting to do X," we definitely wouldn't say that X is
                "explicit" or "explicit no."</strong> We don't know whether they ended up doing the
              action or not. All we know is that they want (or don't want) to do it. So, we
              would choose from "hypothetical," "probable," or the new "probably not."</p>
            <p>What's the best choice among those? I think "hypothetical" is usually the best
              choice if all we know is that they want (or don't want) to do something. We
              don't know what actually happened, so we can just pick "hypothetical!"</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Another batch incoming soon! :-)</p>

    <p class="f4">
    <p>Shorter feedback for this batch!</p>
    <p>If you haven't checked out the last couple extended feedback messages, please do so!
      I've gotten some awesome questions, so we've got a packed FAQ and many more examples.
      Check them out at:</p>
    <p>https://maxwellforbes.com/social-chemistry/resources/rot-breakdown-feedback.html</p>
    <p>A couple small updates:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>One common question: if I see typos in the ROT, should I fix them when writing down
          the action? Answer: Yes, please do!!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>People are working much faster. Based on the pace people had for the last two batches,
          I'm adjusting the HIT pay slightly to $0.61. (I'm still targeting &gt;= $15/hr for the
          vast majority of people.) Thank you for your patience as we iron out the rate!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I'll post one more batch this evening (in a few minutes), and I plan to post more
          throughout the weekend.</p>

    <p class="f4">
    <p>I spent yesterday pouring over detailed statistics and reviewing everyone's work. Here's
      where we're at in terms of how much people agree on answers to the different types of
      questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>54% - ROT: Categorization</li>
      <li>55% - ROT: Moral Foundations</li>
      <li>62% - Action: What portion of people probably agree?</li>
      <li>63% - ROT: What portion of people agree?</li>
      <li>68% - Action: How much cultural pressure do you feel?</li>
      <li>71% - Action: Is the character doing it hypothetically or explicitly?</li>
      <li>81% - Action: What's the original (moral) judgment?</li>
      <li>83% - Writing the Action (from the ROT)</li>
      <li>87% - Action: Is it legal?</li>
      <li>89% - Action: Which character is most likely to do it?</li>
      <li>92% - Action: Agency or Experience?</li>
      <li>93% - ROT: Who is it targeting?</li>
      <li>97% - Is the ROT confusing/vague/low-quality/can't be split?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This might be as you expect. I have gotten the most questions about ROT Categorization
      and Moral Foundations! (Please see the extended batch feedback for more!)</p>
    <p>In the spirit of this, I'm trying a new thing for feedback: showing you areas where you
      disagreed most with other workers, and some examples questions you disagreed on. Those
      individualized statistics appear below in your email.</p>
    <p>Important: don't worry too much about the disagreement! It's meant as a way of
      calibrating you to other people. You may think "oh crap, I <em>did</em> interpret that question
      wrong!" Or, you may think, "Ha! Everyone else is a fool! I'm the only one who got that
      right." I just wanted to start providing it in hopes that more transparency will help us
      all get on the same page.</p>
    <p>I also answered more questions that you guys asked! My answers appear in the extended
      feedback for this batch at:
      https://maxwellforbes.com/social-chemistry/resources/rot-breakdown-feedback.html#200320</p>
    <p>Please take a look!</p>
    </p>


    <p class="f3">Extended feedback</p>
    <p class="f4">
    <p>More questions! Thank you for those who wrote in and sent feedback :-) Slowly but
      surely, I hope to answer you all!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: What do we do about situations where the ROT is multiple ROTs strung
            together?</strong> There were a few that were extremely long and had multiple ROTs in
          them. Do we just pick one and go with that? Or do we just pass on it? I had to
          return a few that were like that. They were just too long and convoluted to write
          anything about and rewriting the sentence would be a mess.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer: Throw them away!</strong> If an ROT smells bad like that --- abnormally long,
            resulting action would be a mess, super hard to break apart and break down ---
            please feel free to hit the huge "The ROT is confusing..." button and just
            submit. These cases should be pretty rare. Don't feel bad flagging these when you
            come across them and just submitting; you don't need to return them!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: if we have an ROT like "You should always wash your hands," do we put
            "always" in with the action or with the judgment part?</strong> Such as action = "always
          washing your hands", and judgment = "should"? Or instead, action = "washing your
          hands", and judgment = "should always"?</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer: Prefer putting more information in the action.</strong> So in this example,
            we'd say that "always washing your hands" is the action, and the judgment is
            "should". (What a timely example...)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: What does "always" mean in ROTs like <em>"You should 'always' wash your
              hands"</em> or <em>"You should 'always' trust your friends"?</em></strong> Do they mean... like
          literally always?</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer: Let's assume people aren't that crazy!</strong> Think of these ROTs as written
            casually, the kinds of things you'd tell someone as a general rule. For example,
            "always" washing your hands probably intends to mean "just being really good about
            it." In other words think of these as "rules of thumb" rather than "absolutes."
            Would you agree, in general, you should try to trust your friends as much as
            possible? (Maybe not!)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: Can you add more examples to the Moral Foundations?</strong> Specifically, some
          fringe / less obvious examples? I feel like I'm still struggling with making
          judgments on these much more so than any other part of the task.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer: Your wish is my command!</strong> I annotated a bunch of examples from this
            last batch with moral foundations. My answers and explanations are below. I've
            also the ones with single answers to the help/instructions section for moral
            foundations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also have three general pieces of guidance:</p>
        <p><strong>BF/GF != "Loyalty/Betrayal"</strong> If we see some kind of significant other mentioned
          (e.g., "boyfriend"), we often jump to "Loyalty/Betrayal." But I'd encourage us to
          think a bit more about what the <em>action</em> is doing! The loyalty / betrayal to the
          relationship isn't always the central theme. (Though sometimes it is!)</p>
        <p><strong>ROT, not Situation.</strong> Try to answer the moral foundations about the ROT, <em>not</em>
          about the Situation! Sometimes a situation will be about betrayal, but the ROT
          will just be about care. And often, different ROTs for a single situation will
          address different moral foundations. (Though sometimes, you will need the
          situation to make sense of the ROT, and that is OK.)</p>
        <p><strong>I see everything!</strong> If you think deeply enough about almost any ROT, you can
          probably dig up implications in all moral foundations. (Which is super
          interesting!) But instead, try to find the <em>main</em> moral foundation (or two) at
          play.</p>
        <p>Here are the examples I annotated. These opinions are just my own, so read through
          my explanations and see if you agree!</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>ROT:</strong> <em>"If you violate someone's trust you should accept the consequences."</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your answers: Care/Harm, Loyalty/Betrayal, Fairness/Cheating</li>
              <li>My answer: Loyalty/Betrayal and Fairness/Cheating</li>
              <li>My explanation: I think that the central action in the ROT, "violating
                someone's trust," is <em>Betrayal</em>. But the ROT also addresses "accept the
                consequences," which involves <em>Fairness</em>. So I would mark both.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>ROT:</strong> <em>"It is not okay to ignore your significant other."</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your answers: Loyalty/Betrayal, Care/Harm</li>
              <li>My answer: Care/Harm</li>
              <li>My explanation: I think the central axis here is <em>Care/Harm</em>, because ignoring
                anyone close to you is rude. You could make a case for <em>Loyalty/Betrayal</em> as
                well, because <em>Loyalty</em> might be <em>why</em> it feels wrong to ignore your
                significant other. But I think that might be verging on too broad, as care for
                anyone could be justified as loyalty.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>ROT:</strong> <em>"It's not OK to upload pictures of someone without their permission."</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your answers: Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Authority/Subversion</li>
              <li>My answer: Loyalty/Betrayal</li>
              <li>My explanation: I think the central idea here is potentially <em>betraying</em>
                someone's trust by uploading a photo of them. This has implications in <em>harm</em>
                and that you're <em>cheating</em> at some unwritten social rules. But those are both
                more easily rooted in the idea of <em>betrayal</em>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>ROT:</strong> <em>"It's wrong to tell people who they can and can't see."</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your answers: Care/Harm, Loyalty/Betrayal, Fairness/Cheating</li>
              <li>My answer: Authority/Subversion</li>
              <li>My explanation: The idea of controlling someone else's actions is an idea of
                (potentially misplaced) <em>authority</em>. It may be <em>unfair</em> and may be <em>harming</em>
                them, but those are secondary effects to the imposition of <em>authority</em>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>ROT:</strong> <em>"It is expected that you help family when asked."</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your answers: Loyalty/Betrayal or 'none'</li>
              <li>My answer: Loyalty/Betrayal or Authority/Subversion</li>
              <li>My explanation: This is a tricky one, because I think it depends on the
                position of the person in their family. If the person has authority, like a
                head of household, then I think it is <em>loyalty</em> that would drive this
                expectation. But if they have less power, like a child, I think this might be
                an instance of <em>authority</em>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>ROT:</strong> <em>"It is okay to get angry with people who wrong you."</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your answers: Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Care/Harm</li>
              <li>My answer: Fairness/Cheating</li>
              <li>My explanation: Someone wronging you may be <em>harm</em>, but I think the central
                action here is "getting angry back." This is an idea of <em>fairness</em>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>ROT:</strong> <em>"It's expected that you give your partner attention."</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your answers: Loyalty/Betrayal, Care/Harm</li>
              <li>My answer: Care/Harm</li>
              <li>My explanation: Similar to the example above, I think the other person being
                <em>your partner</em> is a red herring. In my opinion, this is centrally about
                <em>caring</em> for someone close to you.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>ROT:</strong> <em>"It's good to treat customers well."</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your answers: Care/Harm, Authority/Subversion, Fairness/Cheating</li>
              <li>My answer: Care/Harm and Authority/Subversion</li>
              <li>My explanation: I think the central theme here is treating someone well, which
                is about <em>care</em>. A close second would be the relationship with a customer,
                which I think has to do with <em>authority</em> mandating some kind of behavior. So I
                would probably mark those two. Depending on the situation, the idea of
                <em>fairness/cheating</em> might come up---e.g., if a coworker is shirking their
                duties to treat customers well.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>ROT:</strong> <em>"It's wrong not to share your living space."</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your answers: Fairness/Cheating, Care/Harm</li>
              <li>My answer: Fairness/Cheating</li>
              <li>My explanation: While "sharing is caring," I think the idea of <em>fairness</em> is
                central to the idea of sharing what's yours. In this case, it was with a
                roommate, who is presumably also paying rent. But it's a tricky one, because
                that interpretation does depend on the situation.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>ROT:</strong> <em>"It's bad to file false insurance claims."</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your answers: Fairness/Cheating, Authority/Subversion</li>
              <li>My answer: Fairness/Cheating</li>
              <li>My explanation: This is a classic <em>cheating</em> example.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>ROT:</strong> <em>"It is mean to call someone out publicly."</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your answers: Care/Harm</li>
              <li>My answer: Care/Harm</li>
              <li>My explanation: We agree: this is <em>harming</em> someone.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>ROT:</strong> <em>"You shouldn't tell your friends what to do."</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your answers: Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal</li>
              <li>My answer: nothing</li>
              <li>My explanation: Telling other friends what to do feels like a mixture of many
                things. It's potentially granting yourself too much <em>authority</em>, it's <em>unfair</em>
                to them, and it may be a <em>betrayal</em> of trust that could <em>harm</em> your
                friendship. In this kind of situation, I'd probably mark nothing. It's too
                broad of a mixture.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>ROT:</strong> <em>"It is okay to not want to be around someone that is sick."</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your answers: Sanctity/Degradation, Care/Harm</li>
              <li>My answer: Sanctity/Degradation</li>
              <li>My explanation: There are potential secondary implications of not <em>caring</em> for
                someone that is sick. But the primary idea here is <em>sickness</em> and the spread
                of disease, which I think falls best under <em>sanctity/degradation</em>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: Can you also add more real-world examples to the ROT Categorization?</strong>
          These are difficult, just like the Moral Foundations!</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer: Coming soon!</strong> I want to send out another batch before 2021, so I'm
            going to punt on this for the next round of batch feedback. I'll be hard at work
            on it while you're working on the next batch!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: Can we drop the "you" when rewriting into action and judgement?</strong> I know
          you kind of covered this with regard to placement of subject in action vs judgement.
          But in the last example on the Instructions page, "You" is placed in the judgement, and
          at other times it feels like it should just be dropped altogether. Is this okay to do?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>ROT - It's expected that you tip 15% for good service</li>
              <li>Action - tipping 15% for good service</li>
              <li>Judgement - it's expected</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Answer: Yes!</strong> This is exactly right. I've updated the example to remove the
              "you" in the judgment.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: Longer ROTs can be hard to split and rewrite!</strong> For example, look at two
          difficult examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Example 1: Rewriting the perspective</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>ROT - It's wrong for your sister to try to stop you from taking an important class</li>
              <li>Action - trying to stop your brother from taking an important class</li>
              <li>Judgement - it's wrong</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Example 2: Super long ROT</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>ROT - It's wrong to get mad at someone simply because they don't want to do something you want them to
                do</li>
              <li>Action - getting mad at someone simply because they don't want to do something you want them to do
              </li>
              <li>Judgement - It's wrong</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Answer: These are both correct!</strong> Example 1 is a difficult case, where the ROT's
              action requires rephrasing. And example 2 is long, but not too complex to split.
              Both of these are how I would split the ROTs!</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: How do we handle ROTs where new information is introduced that makes the
            action seem only hypothetical?</strong> Do we then mark the whole action as hypothetical?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Situation - Being pissy with my roommate / friend / co worker</li>
              <li>ROT - It's bad to be rude to someone just because you're in a bad mood.</li>
              <li>Action - being rude to someone just because you're in a bad mood</li>
              <li>Character - narrator</li>
              <li><strong>Question:</strong> Should we mark <em>hypothetical</em> here? We don't know if the
                character is being pissy just because they're in a bad mood; something else
                might be going on!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Answer: Yes, please mark "hypothetical" or "probable" in these cases!</strong> Many,
              many ROTs end up introducing additional conditions (like "just because you're in a
              bad mood") that we don't know to be true from the situation. <em>Please</em> make sure to
              mark "hypothetical" or "probable" (whichever seems right to you) in these
              cases!</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: Can we get a "probably not" button?</strong> Sometimes it seems like the action
          probably won't happen, but it isn't explicitly not happening.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer: Not yet.</strong> But let me know if this keeps happening! If it keeps coming
            up, we can consider introducing it. I figured it would be rare enough it wouldn't
            be worth complicating the task further, but I might have been wrong!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="f3">Email message</p>
    <p class="f4">
    <p>Thank you to everyone who worked on this first batch and wrote in feedback!</p>
    <p>Here are the two biggest updates you need to know about:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>I am more than doubling the pay for future HITs.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I answered ten of the most common questions at length, but the result was so long it
          won't fit in this email. (Seriously, mturk won't let me send it.) So I started a webpage
          where I'll post all batch feedback messages (like this one!) along with answers to
          common questions that won't fit in the email. It lives here:
          https://maxwellforbes.com/social-chemistry/resources/rot-breakdown-feedback.html</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>More info:</p>
    <p>For 1., I heard you loud and clear: the pay was too low! I ran the numbers, and given
      how long folks were spending on the HITs, I bumped up the pay to $0.73. I'll keep
      running the numbers for future batches.</p>
    <p>As context: I set the original pay based on my own pace. I figured it was a bit
      aggressive, but I was thinking that after like 100,000 HITs, everyone will be moving
      much faster than at the beginning. And I worried that you guys would be heartbroken if I
      ever <em>lowered</em> the pay rate. However, I now realize that it's probably better if the
      rate adjusts along with you, and so it should start higher while you're learning the
      task. (And while I would love to pay everyone $30+/hr, I do have a budget I have to
      follow!) So, tl;dr: I am hoping that with mutual trust, I can adjust the pay rate over
      time as we all ramp up to this new HIT. I will keep updating the pay based on new
      batches!</p>
    <p>For 2., I received A TON of feedback on this first batch! Thank you all so much! In
      fact, I received so much that I just <em>can't</em> reply to all of it :-( So many of you
      pointed out individual situations or ROTs that you wanted feedback on, but I just don't
      have the bandwidth to reply individually---it took me nearly a week just to get all of
      this group feedback written! So, I hope you will forgive me.</p>
    <p>However, what I did was collect the most common questions and pitfalls, and start an
      extended FAQ that will contain <em>all</em> batch feedback messages like this one. The URL
      (once again) is: https://maxwellforbes.com/social-chemistry/resources/rot-breakdown-feedback.html. I've also
      posted a link to that page in the HIT itself.</p>
    <p>Please do give that page a glance when you have time. Here are the questions I answered
      on it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What do I do about ROTs that don't have a judgment?</li>
      <li>What do I do about vague or confusing ROTs?</li>
      <li>How should I rate actions that affect the doer of the action positively?</li>
      <li>Some ROTs don't fit into any moral foundation categories!</li>
      <li>When rewriting the ROT, do we include the subject in the action?</li>
      <li>Can we disagree with the original ROT in picking our judgment?</li>
      <li>Should we be using the situation to help us answer the ROT categorization or Moral Foundations?</li>
      <li>How should we handle ROTs with "if" in them?</li>
      <li>Is there always a narrator?</li>
      <li>Will there be bonuses like there were with writing ROTs?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Anyway, this has already become a novel, so I'll stop now. I'm going to post another
      batch in a few minutes, and I'm working on a new feedback tool that will give you deeper
      insight into how you and fellow workers are performing. I hope to finish this ASAP and
      test it for future batches!</p>
    <p>Thank you again. Talk soon. (And stay safe!)</p>
    </p>


    <p class="f3">Extended feedback</p>
    <p class="f4">
    <p>Here are my answers to the ten most common questions. Thank you again to everyone who
      wrote in with feedback and questions!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: What do I do about ROTs that don't have a judgment?</strong> There are many ROTs
          that seem like they can't be split into action and judgment. These often fall into the
          "it is what it is" category. For example, "Friends sometimes want to wear matching
          outfits."</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Answer: For many "it is what it is" ROT, the judgment is implicitly "expected
                / OK."</strong> You can transcribe it like this: the action is "friends sometimes
              wearing matching outfits," and the moral judgment is "expected / OK." After all,
              the ROT is simply describing what people do sometimes.</p>
            <p>But sometimes there are ROTs that you really can't figure out how to break down.
              Maybe they're super unclear, or just plain incomprehensible. For these, please
              check the big dark box under the text entry that starts with "The ROT is
              confusing..." and submit the HIT! This box is there exactly so you can flag ROTs
              where it's too hard to split a clear action and judgment. (You'll need to simply
              make your best guesses for the top section.)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Change I made:</strong> I made the "Can't split the rot into action and judgment"
              button bigger and darker so it's more noticeable. I also added to it the text
              "ROT is confusing, extremely vague, or very low quality." Please feel free to
              use it whenever you feel like the ROT is a lost cause and should be trashed!</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: What do I do about vague or confusing ROTs?</strong> Some ROTs are very hard to
          understand, even using the situation as context. Or maybe they're full of typos, or
          just plain crap. (Hopefully this is rare!)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Answer: Use the big dark button (starts with "The ROT is confusing...", right
                below the action/judgment text entry) to mark the ROT as garbage, and submit the
                HIT.</strong> (You'll still need to make your best guesses for the top section.) See
              the question above for more details.</p>
            <p>Many workers feel bad about using buttons like these. Obviously we don't want to
              abuse this button to skip work, and we want to make an effort to understand and
              break down ROTs whenever possible. <strong>But for truly bad ROTs, it really helps me
                when you tell me about them.</strong> I <em>want</em> to know about bad ROTs so I can discard
              them later.</p>

        <p><strong>Question: How should I rate actions that affect the doer of the action positively?</strong>
          The description for "Good" says "these behaviors affect others positively." But some
          actions involve doing good for oneself. For example, some actions involve putting
          your own mental health first.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Answer: For self-treating ROTs, transcribe the judgment (e.g., "good"), and
                then mark your (expected) agreement with the morality of that action (e.g., is
                it morally good).</strong> This is an AMAZING question, and it digs really deep into
              moral philosophy.</p>
            <p>Traditionally, morality explicitly deals with actions <em>between</em> people. E.g.,
              "actions with motives of self-interest, self-preservation ... and happiness ...
              (do) not express a good will ... (and) an action has moral worth only if it
              expresses a good will" (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/). So, by
              this view, actions towards oneself <em>cannot</em> be moral, and we would mark them all
              as "expected/OK."</p>
            <p>However: (a) philosophers do disagree about this; (b) "pure" morality also
              wouldn't involve sympathy towards friends and family, which our ROTs are full of;
              and (c) I think it's easier if we lean towards transcribe the judgments literally,
              and then mark less agreement in the next question if we think people in society
              might not agree that actions towards oneself can be moral.</p>
            <p>(With that said, please do continue to mark obviously non-moral actions like
              "it's good to go on walks" as simply "expected / OK.")</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: Some ROTs don't fit into any moral foundation categories!</strong> Taking the
          same example from above, what about an ROT like, "Friends sometimes want to wear
          matching outfits." This doesn't seem to have any moral foundations, what do I do?</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer: Then please pick zero moral foundations.</strong> If you don't think any
            moral foundations apply, simply don't check any! Many ROTs don't have clear
            moral angles. In those situations, it's completely fine not to check any moral
            foundations. In fact, I <em>strongly prefer</em> you don't check any moral foundations
            when you think that none apply. This helps us understand when moral foundations
            are <em>actually</em> relevant!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: When rewriting the ROT, do we include the subject in the action?</strong> For
          example, take the ROT: "Parents should watch their children." Do we say
          action="watching their children" and judgment="parents should"? Or do we say
          action="parents watching their children" and judgment="should"?</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer: Usually, yes. Put as much info in the action as possible.</strong> For that
            example, put action="parents watching their children." In general, <em>we want the
              actions to contain as much information as possible.</em> This usually means that an
            action should be as specific as its ROT.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: Can we disagree with the original ROT in picking our judgment?</strong> For
          example, take an ROT like "It’s okay to ditch your family for fun." What if I don't
          believe that? Or for example, what about an ROT like "It's wrong for two men to
          marry." What if I don't agree with that?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Answer: Usually, no. In almost all cases, please <em>keep</em> the original judgment,
                and mark your disagreement in the "how many agree" field.</strong> The reason is that
              <em>someone</em> wrote that ROT, and so we can assume <em>some</em> people believe it (even if
              some, or even most, people disagree). We want to faithfully transcribe
              controversial ROTs, then capture that some people disagree with it!
            </p>
            <p>The only time we want to <em>change</em> the judgment is when the word used doesn't
              match a moral or ethical judgment. For example, "advice" ROTs, like "It's good
              to relax on the couch," where we know that "relaxing on the couch" isn't
              actually morally "good."</p>
            <p>Takeaway: <strong>When in doubt, just literally transcribe the judgment.</strong></p>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: Should we be using the situation to help us answer the ROT categorization
            or Moral Foundations?</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Answer: No.</strong> When possible, try to understand and break down the ROT on its
              own. We want these ROTs and breakdowns to be "portable," in that they could
              apply to multiple situations.</p>
            <p>With that said, sometimes the ROT is too hard to understand without the
              situation. In those cases, it's OK to interpret the ROT in the context of the
              situation.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: How should we handle ROTs with "if" in them?</strong> For example, "It's OK to
          ghost a friend if they've hurt you."</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer: Include it in the action.</strong> I usually do this by changing "if" to
            "when." For example: "ghosting a friend when they've hurt you." In general, we
            want to try to make the action as detailed/specific as the ROT.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: Is there always a narrator?</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer: Yes.</strong> Assume that a narrator is the one saying each situation. This
            means for a situation like "not wanting to tip," we can assume the narrator is
            the one doing it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Question: Will there be bonuses like there were with writing ROTs?</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Answer: Not at this time.</strong> I'm planning that the pay from the HITs will cover
            the full compensation (with small batch bonuses to send feedback messages). The
            ROT writing bonuses were mainly because of the variance in writing 1--5 ROTs.
            However, know that I am constantly closely monitoring how long people spend
            working on the HITs, and I will adjust the rate as needed to make sure a large
            percentage of people are making at least $15/hr. We're still very early on in
            the task, so I expect people's rates to change over time!</li>
