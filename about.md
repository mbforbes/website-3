## Now

As of November 2022, I'm traveling indefinitely and writing about where I go.
These [travel essays](/studio/#travel) alternate between blocks of crappy iPhone photos and stories of things that confused me.
I also end up writing a [blog post](/blog/) roughly weekly, occasionally tending to to my [notes](/garage/), and preparing a monthly website digest (subscribe at the bottom of any page).

## Testimonials

It's very important what others think about you.

> _Max is my favorite of your friends because he always fills the ice trays._

> _In a talent show where the bar isn't too high, you would do all right._

<!-- > _You fact-checking spider! You rollerblading vampire!_ -->

## Miscellany

- I play the tenor sax, clarinet, and piano. "A gentleman is a man who can play the saxophone, but doesn’t" continues to haunt me.

- I am perpetually learning to boulder (= climb little rocks with expensive shoes that hurt)

- I'm from Seattle. As mandated by local law, I drink a ton of coffee, love IPAs,
  and wear beanies all the time.

## Friends

I miss the [GeoCities days](http://www.hypnospace.net/), when personal pages were the rage. Behold, some friends with websites:

- [**Callan Berry**](https://mumblecity.com/) • comic artist and designer; hilarious and personable; seems to always know full plots to games and movies before they're out.

<!-- Cooper's website is gone :-( -->
<!--

  enthusiast, and policy analyst; meticulous and sincere; the best candidate for our
  band name was "Urban Toast."

  and down-to-earth; I once witnessed him pull a taco out of his pocket.
