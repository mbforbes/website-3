## Now

As of May 2024, I'm working on bootstrapping a small software business.
My first product, a game called [Talk to Me Human](https://talktomehuman.com/) is finally out in early access after ten months. It will probably take me a few more months to do the full release.
Right now the garden of this website is pretty desolate, so I'm excited to plant new seeds.
I also need to get my monthly digest back up and running.

## Testimonials

It's very important what others think about you.

> _Max is my favorite of your friends because he always fills the ice trays._

> _In a talent show where the bar isn't too high, you would do all right._

<!-- > _You fact-checking spider! You rollerblading vampire!_ -->

## Miscellany

- I play the tenor sax, clarinet, and piano. "A gentleman is a man who can play the saxophone, but doesn’t" continues to haunt me.

- I am perpetually learning to boulder (= climb little rocks with expensive shoes that hurt)

- I'm from Seattle. As mandated by local law, I drink a ton of coffee, love IPAs,
  and wear beanies all the time.

## Friends

I miss the [GeoCities days](http://www.hypnospace.net/), when personal pages were the rage. Behold, some friends with websites:

- [**Ally Gale**](https://allygale.online/) • developer and lindy hopper; vivacious and thoughtful; exploring abandoned places since before geocaching was cool.

- [**Callan Berry**](https://mumblecity.com/) • comic artist and designer; hilarious and personable; seems to always know full plots to games and movies before they're out.

- [**Greg Technology**](https://greg.technology/) • bountiful hacker and map guru; overflowing with support; improvises songs as a means of telling you important news.
