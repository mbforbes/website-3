<!-- > _You fact-checking spider! You rollerblading vampire!_ -->

## Miscellany

- I play the tenor sax, clarinet, and piano. "A gentleman is a man who can play the saxophone, but doesn’t" continues to haunt me.

- I am perpetually learning to boulder (= climb little rocks with expensive shoes that hurt)

- I'm from Seattle. As mandated by local law, I drink a ton of coffee, love IPAs,
  and wear beanies all the time.

## Friends

I miss the [GeoCities days](http://www.hypnospace.net/), when personal pages were the rage. Behold, some friends with websites:

- [**Alex Miller**](http://spacefiller.space/) • digital visual artist; curious and warm; loves trying all the drinks from Japanese vending machines.

- [**Callan Berry**](https://mumblecity.com/) • comic artist and designer; hilarious and personable; seems to always know full plots to games and movies before they're out.

- [**Cooper Smith**](https://schmidlak.com/) • pixel artist, drummer, retro game
  enthusiast, and policy analyst; meticulous and sincere; the best candidate for our
  band name was "Urban Toast."

- [**Steve Geluso**](http://5tephen.com/) • teacher and freelance developer; courageous
  and down-to-earth; I once witnessed him pull a taco out of his pocket.

## Internet people I am a fan of

- [**Bret Victor**](http://worrydream.com/) • interaction and abstraction

- [**Mu-An Chiou**](http://muan.co/) • rhythm, space, movement, color

- [**Steven Wittens**](http://acko.net/) • insane 3d animations
