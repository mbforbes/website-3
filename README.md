# website-3

Third (personal) website.

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Redirects

Just documenting this. Two techniques for two purposes: (1) moved URLs, (2) invented URLs for tweakers like me.

1. `redirect_from`
    - https://brianm.me/posts/eleventy-redirect-from/
2. `redirect_to`
    - uses same HTML
    - check redirects/ folder

## WIP

- travel section
    - **/posts/2022-france/**

- don't forget
    - image macros (want to fully figure out first?)
    - consistent attributions
    - start / end dates
    - (adjust some old publish dates to just be end dates? or just display end date on index?)
    - maybe: metadata on travel post
    - maybe: next/prev browser (by post or travel date?)


- blog filenames
    - **2022-08-07-blah-blah**
