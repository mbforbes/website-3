# website-3

Third (personal) website.

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Redirects

Just documenting this. Two techniques for two purposes: (1) moved URLs, (2) invented URLs for tweakers like me.

1. `redirect_from`
    - https://brianm.me/posts/eleventy-redirect-from/
2. `redirect_to`
    - uses same HTML
    - check redirects/ folder

## WIP

- travel section
    - **/posts/2022-france/**

- blog filenames
    - **2022-08-07-blah-blah**
